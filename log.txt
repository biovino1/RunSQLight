Pretty miserable when I think about it, but was able to zone out and just cruise at 6:40 pace with a last mile of 6:13. Probably the best way to end a 71 mile week. Arch in my right foot went from about a 2/10 pain in the beginning to a 5/10 pain on the run at around mile 9, and went back down to a 4/10 towards the end. I need to make sure this doesn't get out of hand.

2017-02-05	3:31 PM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:51:32													Good run after a bad week. Foot was bothering me more than it has been the past few days on the first few miles.

2017-06-12	9:41 AM	Run	Easy	6.02	Mile	0:42:31													First day of summer practice. Really slow first mile at 7:41 because its everyone's first day back, except for me. Ran by myself for pretty much the rest of it. Felt more tired than I thought I would on the flat rails to trails, but it was pretty hot and I was sweating a ton.

2017-06-19		Run	Easy	7.24	Mile	0:51:43													Rails to Trails day. Warm up 1.25 then a 6 mile out and back. First three miles were at 22 minutes, then the next three were 20:17 minutes with a 6:16 mile at the end. Definitely could have gone faster if I didn't do 8 just 10 hours before the run with little food/water in between, but it could be worse.

2017-06-21	8:54 AM	Run	Easy	3.01	Mile	0:23:38													Some slooooow mileage after the workout. Felt tired and dead for all 3 miles, was slowing down by a second each mile. Had a talk with coach and he agreed we been working too much.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1									
2017-06-22	8:10 AM	Run	Easy	5.78	Mile	0:46:24													Probably the slowest day I've ever had. Between yesterday's K work and the Crider property, there was no way it was gonna be any faster. Lots of stops and breaks. Not very solid mileage.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1

Felt tired after 7 miles, definitely wanted to be done, but was able to push on and finish with the last 2 miles at 6:30 and a decent sprint at the end. This is the first of many real long runs, and hopefully they all run just as well. <br><br>This run was really on Saturday, but for the sake of the graph, I'm putting it to Sunday.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1									
2017-06-26	8:30 AM	Run	Easy	8.11	Mile	0:56:30													Solid run at Rails to Trails. Slowest mile on the 7 miler was 7:11 and kept it under 6:50 for the last 3 miles. Coach biked with me the whole way back, everyone else ran at most 6 for the day.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1

2017-07-09	8:20 AM	Run	Long	11.02	Mile	1:13:59													Awesome long run with Isaac on the B-Line.

Had a really good start, beating everyone on the first 4 K's, then just fell apart on the last two. Jake beat me on the last K. Isaiah beat me on the last two, by a good amount. <br><br>Went out too hard in the beginning. Too excited to do well, didn't pace myself like I should have. Every K turned into a race with Isaiah and that wasn't good. Averaged 3:16, worse than a few weeks ago. 				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1									
2017-07-12	9:27 AM	Run	Hill	0.91	Mile	0:7:23													5 IU hill repeats. Very tired and lightheaded.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1

2017-07-15	8:03 AM	Run	Race	3.10	Mile	0:17:08													PR at the eagle 5k. 5:35, 5:31, 5:32 with a 28 second .10.<br><br>Overall a very solid race, especially considering I can already PR with just 6 weeks of mostly mileage. Isaiah and Paul were ahead by 7 and 4 seconds and it is frustrating. Went out way to slow in the first K at a 3:27, while they were at 3:19. That's just too much to make up. Need to go out faster, even if it's just 5 or 6 seconds.

2017-07-16	8:15 AM	Run	Long	12.11	Mile	1:23:38													Solid long run to South and back with Andy and Isaiah. Felt fairly tired from the race yesterday but held a good pace.

2017-07-19	8:36 AM	Run	Interval	3.67	Mile	0:19:28													Decent K workout at IU.<br><br>3:25, 3:09, 3:09, 3:22, 3:20, 3:03 (7 min cycle)<br><br>Isaiah was a head of me by a good amount. Didn't feel like I could do much better. I don't know if the mileage is working against me, or it was just in my head and I didn't want to work that hard. Not a bad workout, but not a lot of improvement despite the mileage. A little bit frustrated.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1									
2017-07-19	9:24 AM	Run	Hill	1.05	Mile	0:7:57													Hills after the workout. Averaged about 23 seconds on the IU hill, going slightly faster than race pace. A lot better than last week's hills.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1

It definitely hurt, but pushed much harder than yesterday. Again, frustrating, but still a good run.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1

2017-07-27	5:36 PM	Run	Easy	4.00	Mile	0:30:00													Rest of the relay runs. Just guessing on distance and times. Team got second to last. It was fun though.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1

2017-08-05	8:40 AM	Run	Interval	4.80	Mile	0:25:06													5:22, 5:15, 4:58 on the Cascades mile loop. Michael and I won it all, after closing maybe a 7 second gap with Paul in the lead going into the last mile. First mile was probably too conservative, but a 4:58 is pretty sweet.<br><br>3:14, 3:10, 3:07 on the Cascades K loop.

2017-08-08	8:35 AM	Run	Interval	3.78	Mile	0:19:45													Really solid K repeats. The second K was made longer to a full K, which is why they are slower than usual, but much more accurate.

Great weather, had my shirt off. Played a lot of basketball afterwards and was extremely tired. Lots of fun though.<br><br>For future reference, feeling pretty good on week 3. Been kind of sore all week, but this has been a pretty fast week with a 6:37 pace 7 mile run, a track workout, and this long run.

Felt very good as well.<br><br>Overall a solid first month of training. No crazy mileage, no crazy distance runs, just solidness all around. Definitely ready to up mileage to 55 next week, and probably hold 60 for two or three weeks. I would like to have some fast runs in there and some tempo workouts, but I think this is a really good start. Absolutely no fatigue whatsoever, just some soreness in the heel that is very manageable. With another three months before north indoor really begins, there is plenty of time to get better, and this is a good foundation to build off of.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1

2017-12-17	4:16 PM	Run	Long	11.10	Mile	1:14:19													Awesome long run in the hood. Felt sore in the beginning, but managed to run low 6:30 miles toward the end and held form very well. Running alone isn't too bad anymore, I'm able to hold focus and work on breathing/form and keep a good pace. <br><br>Probably gonna be sore tomorrow from this, and the workouts (300's, T-Pace) this week but it was a good week. Definitely got better.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2017-12-18	3:22 PM	Run	Easy	8.11	Mile	0:54:32													Had 2 medium-hard miles at cascades, 6:30 and 5:36. The rest was mileage. Really tired after the miles, slow as hell up cascades.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2017-12-19	3:20 PM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:57:43													Still really sore, slower run with lots of little stops. We went down Bales, gravel road to Cascades, up 17th. Some basketball at miles's house afterwards.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1

Obviously would like to have beaten one of them, but not a bad time. <br><br>Splits were 68, 73, 71, 72 <br>Bit of a fast first lap but held pace very well.<br><br>				Nike	Victory 3	9.50	US/Canada										
2017-12-21	4:23 PM	Run	Interval	3.49	Mile	0:21:42													12 300's on the track, pace was generally 57s.<br><br>63, 58, 59, 58, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 55, 55, 49<br><br>Felt very good despite the 4:45 mile before.

2017-12-24	3:37 PM	Run	Long	12.08	Mile	1:20:43													Insane long run in the hood with a lot of snow. Held a really good pace throughout, legs started to give out towards the end and had a bad diaphragm cramp. Wind also picked up in the middle of the run and my face got wrecked by the snow.

2017-12-28	8:50 PM	Run	Tempo	5.00	Mile	0:28:20													Tempo mileage during the treadmill workout. Did 2x2 + 1 tempo miles with one easy mile in between. I wanted to do some work outside, but I had no motivation because of the cold. Felt really good considering the work, but treadmill running always feels easy. If nothing else, it was a good way to pass the run faster and get heart rate up a little bit. Legs feel a little bit tired too, so I guess that's a good sign too.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2017-12-29	11:09 AM	Run	Easy	8.04	Mile	0:53:26													Cold run with Isaac down to poo plant and back. Slow first mile at a 7:01, rest were pretty fast. 6:44 back to back miles in between the big hill. Felt really tired going up it, but it makes sense. Good run.

2017-12-31	4:12 PM	Run	Long	4.02	Mile	0:26:56													First third of 12 miles, had some rough shin pain that stopping and stretching couldn't stop. Went inside to roll out, take some ibuprofen, and rest.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2017-12-31	9:30 PM	Run	Long	8.01	Mile	0:53:53													Rest of the long run mileage on the treadmill. No shin pain at all, glad I stopped.<br><br>Overall not crazy proud about this week, I ended up doing two doubles when I wanted none. 60 miles is never bad mileage, but I was hoping for a little bit better. <br><br>Next week I would like to get 60 with no doubles and a good tempo workout somewhere in there. If I feel good enough, maybe get 65, but patience is key, especially when I feel this good. This week has left me wanting for more, but if I don't double up and get a good workout and long run, I'll be happy.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2018-01-01	3:19 PM	Run	Easy	8.12	Mile	0:53:01													Quick 8 mile run in the hood. Nice and sunny, 7 degrees out. Had my mask on pretty much the whole time.

2018-01-02	3:32 PM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:54:56													Nice run down the gravel hill, to the highway and back. The gravel hill was very tough, but I didn't stop before or afterwards, so that's something to be proud of. 7:24 last mile, not even bad.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2018-01-03	4:14 AM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:54:51													Cold poo plant run. The river was frozen and threw some rocks. Legs a bit sore from the gravel hill.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1

2018-01-04	8:30 PM	Run	Tempo	5.00	Mile	0:28:20													Tempo mileage on the 8 mile treadmill run. Same as last week, felt harder, probably because of the incline change from 1 to 2. Seems like a small change, but over 28 minutes of hard running it probably makes a difference. I'm glad it felt harder though, it means I got a lot out of today. Good workout.<br><br>2x2 tempo run + 1, 1 easy mile in between each set				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1

2018-01-07	3:23 PM	Run	Long	13.10	Mile	1:26:00													Another day, another half marathon pr. Didn't feel great at the beginning, but held pace in the middle and went fast towards the end. Pretty insane pace, big pr by almost 2 minutes. Felt warm out at 35 degrees, a little bit of wind. <br><br>This week was exactly what I wanted after last week. Awesome average pace, great T-Pace workout Thursday, and literally my best long run ever, with very little pain except for some shin soreness. Can't wait to ramp up the mileage just a little bit more, focus a bit less on the distance runs, and have some dope ass workouts/time trials. I'm in the best shape of my life, time to show it.

2018-01-08	3:41 PM	Run	Easy	8.03	Mile	0:55:57													Lonely poo plant run, feeling a bit sluggish from the long run yesterday so took it nice and slow. Felt good up the hill.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1

The goal was to hit 12 at 75 seconds, but I started to hit 76's in the second half. I was on my own, the rest was short, the wind was shit, and the drizzle was plentiful. Given the circumstances I think this was a very good workout, but I do wish I had the team there for just a little bit of extra motivation towards the end to keep hitting 75. Brian was on the track to time me, gave me some words of encouragement and cooled down with me. He's a very cool guy.<br><br>Short rest of like 25 seconds of basically walking, so I didn't count that, but it was all continuous.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1

2018-01-12	8:30 PM	Run	Easy	7.06	Mile	0:48:32													Another treadmill run because of all the snow outside, hopefully I can run outside tomorrow. Was going to do 8 but I figured it would be more fun to do 7 this run and do 9 tomorrow just to switch up from doing 8 every day. <br><br>Felt really good considering the morning run and workout yesterday. Had the incline at 2 and a solid pace, really no soreness at all. 				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2018-01-13	6:00 PM	Run	Easy	9.00	Mile	1:00:33													Long ass treadmill run again, still a ton of snow outside. Felt good though, a bit tired towards the end but it was a good pace. 9 miles isn't that bad, a good way to push my endurance just a little bit further.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2018-01-14	3:30 PM	Run	Long	13.00	Mile	1:28:07													Just not my day. Went outside to test the roads and they were too icy, so it was my third day on the treadmill. Ran for half a mile then the cord got pulled so I had to stop, then michael called and we talked for a bit. Got back to my run and felt rough by the 8th mile. On the 10th mile the cord got pulled AGAIN so I just took it as a sign and walked for a minute, got some water, and took the last 2.5 miles easier. <br><br>Not exactly a fulfilling run, but I got 65 for the week so fuck you world. My feet are pretty sore though, that kind of sucks. Hopefully I can actually run outside next week, I miss it.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2018-01-15	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	4.07	Mile	0:28:49													More treadmill, absolutely terrible. Feet were getting sore again so I just stopped. Losing my mind.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1

2018-01-19	3:30 PM	Run	Easy	8.21	Mile	0:57:27													A better day today, didn't sleep much the night before. Legs felt decent. Sidewalks still not great, 3rd day of doing mileage around north, getting kind of bored.				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2018-01-20	10:53 AM	Run	Easy	6.06	Mile	0:42:15													Decent run with Isaiah and Nathaniel before watching Isaac run. Did not feel too good, probably dehydrated and a bit sleep deprived at this point. Kicked somewhat with Isaiah towards the end, that was fun. 				Brooks	Launch  4	9.50	US/Canada	v1									
2018-01-21	2:59 PM	Run	Long	11.10	Mile	1:14:22													An oddly good long run for a not so great week. Good pace, awesome kick with a 5:52 mile at the end. Legs felt fine, chest felt tight - probably just from not working hard all week, not used to it. <br><br>Need to refocus next week to hit higher mileage, drink more water, and sleep a lot more.

Broke Drew on the 4th 400, he was never the same. Tried to come back in the last 200's, I got angry and beat him some more. Felt oddly good for how much I was beating people, especially after a rough 800. If I keep my mileage up I think I can handle this kind of workload. I am excited.

Best on the team on every one, Drew was off doing a sprinter's workout. I usually didn't lead and waited to kick with about a lap to go. Led the entire last one, was probably the hardest one. Felt really good during, I never really hit a wall, but very dead afterwards. I am even more excited than I was on Monday. <br><br>My plan is to keep hitting around 60 miles a week and really putting a focus on workouts, not so much the distance runs.

2018-04-21	11:00 AM	Run	Race	0.50	Mile	0:2:06													Nice .8 pr for the 800! Essentially alone the whole race, so I did a good job pushing myself.				Nike	Victory 3	9.50	US/Canada										
2018-04-21	3:30 PM	Run	Race	2.00	Mile	0:10:15													Yet another rough 3200, was out of it from the first 200 meters. Slowly passed more and more throughout the race but I wasn't even close to the top pack, and I don't think I ever could have been up there. I feel out of shape because of how little mileage I've been running lately and I don't think I can get my base back without feeling over trained.				Nike	Victory 3	9.50	US/Canada

Foot hurt a little before the run, and my ankle is stiff now but I think if I keep foam rolling, stretching my calves before the runs, and icing my foot it should be alright. It's just easy runs from here and out for awhile.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

2018-06-05	7:34 AM	Run	Easy	4.01	Mile	0:27:17													Early morning solo run before King's Island, went pretty well even though I woke up feeling dumb tired. Ankle was stiff and I could tell my right quad was straining more than my left. 6:49 might be a bit too fast for the first week back, I'll try and slow down a bit on the rest of my runs this week, especially the long run, but I'd rather be in a position where I need to slow down than speed up! So it's all going well.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-06	7:40 AM	Run	Easy	5.02	Mile	0:35:10													17th street with Isaac and Andy. The fast pace has been catching up to me, 7:33 first mile! Pretty sore and tired but still feeling strong.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

Really didn't hurt bad until the last half mile, tummy got pretty upset. Won my age group and I think got 4th overall, winner was a 16:58.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-10	7:43 AM	Run	Long	8.05	Mile	0:54:30													Long run with Isaac, Andy, and Pete down on the B-Line. Got super dark super fast, but thankfully didn't rain too much. The pace got to me towards the end but I held it pretty well, not even super sore at the moment. My longest first long run ever I think, I want to work on making them longer because it's where I feel I get the most benefit from running. All in all a really good run and a good first week!				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-11	1:52 PM	Run	Easy	5.08	Mile	0:34:30													Solo run in the hood today, humid as balls in hell. Was out of breath by the 2nd mile and still made it to five at a decent pace. Probably whipped too from the long run yesterday. Running in the morning proves once again it is the king.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-12	8:07 AM	Run	Easy	5.15	Mile	0:36:14													2 mile warmup, 1 hard mile at 5:47 with Isaac, and then a slow 2 mile cool down. Felt pretty tired for the first time today, although honestly just going slow makes me feel tired. A lot of rest in between each one, which is probably for the best.

I think the pace of the runs is starting to really catch up. Foot and knee feel great though, that's a plus.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-14	8:06 AM	Run	Easy	5.15	Mile	0:35:41													2 mile warmup with Isaac and Andy for their workout, then I did 3 miles on the track. Easy day, legs a little tired but feeling pretty good.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-15	8:09 AM	Run	Easy	4.93	Mile	0:34:34													Felt really tired, 7:29 first mile and the rest still hurt after that. Andy biked with me and Isaac downtown and back, started at Cascades. Did some strides after for the race tomorrow.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

2018-06-16	8:05 AM	Run	Race	3.10	Mile	0:17:53													5:45, 5:45, 5:47 with a 35.7 kick<br><br>Not much different than last week except a much faster first mile, definitely came back to bite me in the last mile. This is definitely the most consistent race I've had, pretty insane really, just wish I had more in me in the last mile. Andy gained 20ish seconds on me after the half way point, and I just didn't have it in me to go with him. But it's only my second week in and a 17:53 is pretty impressive I think for how little distance training I've done the past few months. <br><br>Hopefully I can get down to at least a sub 17 by midsummer, maybe even a 16:30. I've got about two months to train for it, I think I can get it done.<br><br>Got second overall.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

2018-06-17	6:09 AM	Run	Long	9.00	Mile	1:02:24													Early ass long run with Isaac and Andy down the Bypass and back. It was still fairly hot and humid even though it was really early. Didn't go all that fast but I was very tired on the way back, breathing hard up the hilly hellscape that is Kinser. Really fun though, and proud of what I can do so far just two weeks in, and after a solid race yesterday. This is a cool start.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-18	8:15 AM	Run	Easy	6.07	Mile	0:41:35													First run in Lakeville, just ran around some random roads, felt like it took forever. It was insanely hot out for 8 am, but surprisingly held on to a good pace. There was a good amount of shade which was nice and no real hills. I'll try going out further on lake trail tomorrow, maybe the creek place one day, and I want to see if LaVille has a track for some rep work coming up. I need to find a hill too. What a new place.

2018-06-19	11:17 AM	Run	Easy	6.03	Mile	0:40:28													Insanely awesome run on a humid ass day after a night I don't really remember. Finished with a 6:19 last mile and I was barely pushing. No foot or knee pain, just pure running and I feel amazing, probably the best I have felt in months! Went down Quinn road which was straight and pretty flat, but not a lot of shade. Still a good place for a nice and quiet out and back. 				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-20	6:07 AM	Run	Easy	6.02	Mile	0:41:19													First real day of the rest of my summer, waking up early as fuck and then working. Actually went pretty well, run went by super fast just felt kinda like shit. Not gonna feel any better tomorrow unless I sleep better, ate like shit. Went out Lake Trail, right on Kennilworth until the bridge that crossed 31. Pretty dope route, like 3 cars I saw total. 				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-21	6:08 AM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:41:09													Pretty good run on the Lake Trail to Kenilworth to Patterson loop. Ran down Mangus a bit and saw the track and Newton Park, loops pretty dope so I'll have to try that out sometime. It was nice and cool down this morning though, made for a good feeling run. 				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-22	8:51 PM	Run	Easy	5.18	Mile	0:35:36													Ran out to Newtown Park and ran on the trail, it was pretty cool actually. There aren't any real measurements to go off of, I kind of made a mile loop, but it would be great for some tempo stuff or just soft surface running. Good run though after star day at Purdue, actually felt very good after a few miles but I cut it short at 5 since I have to wake up soon and run again.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-23	2:11 PM	Run	Easy	6.07	Mile	0:38:56													I think my body was mad that it wasn't racing today, so I went fast as hell after work today. 5:42 last mile, barely working for the whole run at around 6:30 pace. I'm either getting really good really fast or this concrete track called Lakeville is too easy for me.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-24	1:20 PM	Run	Long	10.02	Mile	1:07:26													Nice yet hot first 10 mile run in awhile Did a loop around Quinn and Pierce then the Kennilworth loop. I felt pretty good up until the last 2 or 3 miles, I was really feeling the heat. But it was a good run for being on my own and for the weather!				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-25	12:41 PM	Run	Easy	6.11	Mile	0:41:20													Another kennilworth loop, a little bit muggy outside but otherwise fine for how late I ran. Stupid good pace again, this shit is too easy and I'm worried.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-06-27	2:39 PM	Run	Easy	7.04	Mile	0:47:40													First 7 mile run of the summer, better get used to them! I felt amazing though, tightened up just a little after the 5th mile but I was cruising at 6:30 pace so it's alright. Went down Quinn road, I may have to do a long run there because it's so nice! There are some rolling hills after a while which I actually really like, makes me feel at home. Awesome weather today.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-07-02	7:42 AM	Run	Easy	5.83	Mile	0:39:54													First run in a while with Isaac, Andy, and Isaiah since I'm back in town. I felt okay, just more tired than usual.

2018-07-03	8:00 AM	Run	Hill	1.00	Mile	0:7:59													3 times up and down Cascades, got faster on each rep. Legs were very dead after the third, was an all out sprint. 				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-07-04	8:11 AM	Run	Easy	6.05	Mile	0:41:26													Went down lake trail for an out and back, felt really sore after the hills yesterday but still ran pretty fast. I wanted a slow run but I just felt pretty good. A little boring.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-07-05	3:18 PM	Run	Easy	3.08	Mile	0:21:09													Crazy hot run so I cut it short, wasn't feeling the best. Went out to a new road, it was pretty cool but just too hot.																	
2018-07-06	4:17 PM	Run	Easy	6.24	Mile	0:40:24													Newton Park laps with some friends, last mile was a 5:36. Pretty warm outside but felt really good!				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-07-08	4:21 PM	Run	Long	8.04	Mile	0:51:02													Steamboat run for sure down Quinn and back. A little hot outside but it didn't affect me at all it seems, last two miles were 6:10 and 5:37. This is some good shit even if my mileage is low.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-07-10	9:44 AM	Run	Easy	7.34	Mile	0:49:05													Nice little run down lake trail to Shively, back to town on Kennilworth. Kind of hot for how early it was.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-07-12	8:02 PM	Run	Easy	10.02	Mile	1:09:04													Got bored so I ran 10 miles! Went down Quinn for awhile, then on oak for awhile past Riley, then back on Quinn. Slower pace just so I felt good, and I did! Awesome run.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-07-17	9:15 AM	Run	Easy	6.56	Mile	0:44:39													Fun run in the morning sun with a Kennilworth loop to the housing division and back. Felt really good for not having run in almost a week, thighs were a little tight but good pace, lungs feeling fresh.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

2018-07-31	11:32 AM	Run	Easy	7.05	Mile	0:46:27													Legs and lungs hurt more than I wanted them too, but it was still a fast paced run down Quinn and back. Might be my last run in lakeville, if so it was a good one!				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

Second one was 1 minute on, 1 minute off with a 18:42. Ran with the second group the whole time, felt surprisingly good considering how tired I felt yesterday! Also was not really expecting a workout and I didn't want to make it about me, so I probably could have gone a tiny bit faster but it was a good first workout of the summer pretty much.

2018-08-07	2:27 PM	Run	Easy	4.00	Mile	0:26:30													Hot and windy, and I don't have my watch so I just ran and I kind of ran myself out. It was about 4 on mileage. Otherwise not a bad run given how bad I felt yesterday.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

2018-08-13	8:20 PM	Run	Easy	6.05	Mile	0:41:47													First run at Purdue, fun run around campus.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

2018-08-26	8:27 PM	Run	Long	10.01	Mile	1:08:59													Nice late night long run from the bike trail, to the highway, then around campus back to PVIL. Met some german dude doing 18 miles, I felt small. Quads tightened up around 8 miles but held pace and felt ok.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99								
2018-08-27	4:50 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:49:55													Slower run out to bitch loop with a nature loop, 6.2 when we got back to the co-rec so I ran a little bit more. 6:30 6th mile and 6:40 7th mile, kind of fast but felt good considering yesterday's long run.

2018-08-29	6:30 PM	Run	Easy	6.22	Mile	0:43:36													Fun run to the Chauncy area then residential West Lafayette. Giant ass hill near the elementary school, 0.3 miles. Felt a lot better than I did yesterday, new shoes felt good!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-08-30	3:56 PM	Run	Easy	6.22	Mile	0:41:36													Pre football game run. Felt really good but kind of stopped a lot to retie my shoes, gameday traffic, and construction. Still a good run though, I'm glad that I feel good so soon after the rough Tuesday workout.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-08-31	2:10 PM	Run	Easy	1.52	Mile	0:10:30													Warmup for the workout.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-08-31	2:29 PM	Run	Fartlek	4.48	Mile	0:28:41													5 x 30, 60, 90 second fartlek with equal rest on the xc course. It was fairly hot out, not as bad as Tuesday, but I felt very good! The hills killed on the second loop but the pace on the rests was never above 8 minute pace which I'm happy with, the ons were all around 5:30-5:50 pace I think. Wasn't necessarily going for any pace just wanted to feel good, and I did. <br><br>5:23 pace bust on the last 90 second run. 				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-08-31	2:59 PM	Run	Easy	1.61	Mile	0:11:38													Pleasant cooldown after a pleasant workout.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-09-02	8:14 AM	Run	Long	11.01	Mile	1:15:36													Nice relaxed long run with Henry and Nathaniel, had a few short stops to talk or mess around but all around good long run. Good way to ease into 11 miles without killing myself, felt fairly tired, probably from lack of sleep and hard workout Friday. Good week though, definitely ready to up mileage to 50 though.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-09-03	8:32 PM	Run	Easy	6.54	Mile	0:45:23													Really late run, felt yesterday's long run a little bit and it was dark so hard to go fast when you can't see. Went on a funny little loop, was fun.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-09-04	4:51 PM	Run	Tempo	7.25	Mile	0:46:47													7ish mile hot and humid progression run on the course<br><br>Went 7:08, 6:47, 6:41, 6:27, 5th and 6th unknown because watch died but last one was a 6:09. <br><br>Slowed down a bit probably on the 5th and 6th with Tyler because of the heat but it was a decent run. Took a break inbetween the 3rd lap of the course (6.25 miles) and the last one. I didn't want to push it too hard, I don't think it's worth it to break myself so early in the season when I'm still trying to build mileage. I really don't want to sacrifice mileage because some club says to do a long and hard workout on a day where the heat index is 100. 				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-09-04	5:53 PM	Run	Easy	1.08	Mile	0:8:08													"Cooldown" after the workout, still very hot!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

Was going to shoot for 10 but busted the last one because everyone was going for it, so hey, why not finish fast. Felt amazing, especially given how I've been feeling with all these hot workouts on the course. Was definitely pretty far up in terms of team, definitely varsity on the freshman/varsity team so I'm excited! Race in just a little over a week.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2018-09-09	6:18 PM	Run	Long	11.42	Mile	1:15:36													Awesome ass long run out to the middle of god knows where, Cumberland, back through Happy Hollow (giant ass hill) trail, the Lafayette trails, and through the power plant. Very solid pace, legs tightened up around 7 miles and got rough after 11 but best long run in awhile, so I'm happy!<br><br>"He ran that way, catch him!" 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-09-10	4:48 PM	Run	Easy	6.31	Mile	0:43:45													Walmart loop, definitely feeling yesterday's run but still felt pretty good. Bunch of pace pushers almost ruined it but hey, i got it.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-09-11	4:51 PM	Run	Easy	1.00	Mile	0:7:16													Warmup for the workout.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

Very solid workout definitely surprised myself on the pace for how long this run was, definitely best tempo I've ever had. 				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2018-09-12	7:44 PM	Run	Easy	7.46	Mile	0:53:25													Very solid easy lagoon run, definitely feeling yesterday's tempo in my legs, breathing is very easy though at this pace. 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-09-13	10:25 PM	Run	Easy	6.02	Mile	0:41:52													Late ass run because of the bio exam, ran a lot better than yesterday though. Pace was solid although my legs were still pretty sore and tight, definitely recovering well though from 3 days of VERY solid work from Friday-Tuesday. I won't do the Friday pre-race crap just so I can focus on feeling as good as possible for Sunday, probably no long run this week.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-09-14	3:13 PM	Run	Long	10.01	Mile	1:07:34													Unexpected long run, went out to find a 7 mile loop, got lost, and figured hey, might as well go far. I was going pretty fast until I realized at mile 5 I was half way done and slowed it down, still felt fine by the last mile. The heat was the worst part, pretty thirsty by mile 9. As long as I stretch and get sleep I should be fine by Sunday.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-09-18	7:48 PM	Run	Fartlek	7.37	Mile	0:49:06													Sort of a 6 mile progression run, was slotted for a 30' progression run but I don't know how you progress in minutes so..<br><br>7:13/6:56/6:41/6:30/6:14/5:52 with a cool down 1.47<br><br>Not a bad progression after coming off of my flash fever, felt ok, only really ran that 5:52 because the start of it was on the nice downhill and just felt good because of it. The team probably did it on the course but by the time of day I ran it was too dark to even think about it. Felt good to loosen up like this, very sore afterwards though, that short amount of time off really got me.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-09-19	8:27 PM	Run	Easy	6.04	Mile	0:40:46													Ran to the IM fields, ran SEVEN LOOPS around and somehow went 6:30-6:40 pace? I think the satellite was off given the weird grass field, but I think I deserved it for running on dirt that long. It was a peaceful run though, joints and bones felt happy, still a little sore and felt tired from exam and long day.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-09-20	4:46 PM	Run	Easy	5.65	Mile	0:40:32													Hot, humid, and shitty run with the club, first in a week. Didn't go far or fast, I guess just tired and the heat got the best of me.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

Probably could have done 20 but I was very spent on the last one, basically dying on the last 200 and felt pretty horrible on the cooldown with cramps and pains. With that being said, this was a very, VERY solid workout! Stuck behind Sid the whole second half and, while he got away from me on the last few reps, I was ahead of most people in group 1, and considering how I've felt/ran this week, this gives me a lot of my confidence back after being sick, and other people recognized and commented on that as well. Hopefully this weekend I can run some good mileage, a 7 miler and a 12 miler, and be ready for next week with a good race at Little Tens! I am really excited for all the hard training I've been in the last 6 weeks to pay off. <br>				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2018-09-22	10:28 PM	Run	Easy	7.21	Mile	0:49:25													Nice 2 campus loop long run at 10:30, probably latest I've ever ran outside. Definitely got a few catcalls, which are always welcome				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-09-23	8:05 AM	Run	Long	12.10	Mile	1:21:24													Longest run since JANUARY 14th! Crazy proud of my long runs lately, went with the run club down to some trail in the middle of nowhere (aka Lafayette). This made for 19.3 miles in about 10 hours, with only oriental flavored ramen, peanuts, and some gatorade powdered water to keep me going. Still managed to close in a 6:07 last mile, felt very solid. <br><br>All in all this was a good rebound week from being sick, I was hoping for about 55 this week as a good training week before Little Tens, but this is good enough. I wouldn't say I'm at tip top shape quite yet, I need a few more weeks before I can prove that, but I'm getting close and I can feel it.				Hoka	Clayton 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	129.99

2018-09-25	5:38 PM	Run	Easy	1.66	Mile	0:11:38													Cooldown after the workout.<br><br>Felt really good towards the end and pushed it with Sidd and Max. Definitely faster than tempo but I think it was a good barometer of how I should go out and feel during the race. Not a bad day outside a little sunny and humid. Legs felt a bit rough in the beginning but loosened up before the second tempo. Good workout!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2018-09-27	4:46 PM	Run	Easy	7.16	Mile	0:48:47													Fun run with Jason down to Happy Hollow, didn't want to do the workout because fuck pre race workouts, mileage is way cooler. Feel a little more sore than I would like but I can take it easy tomorrow and feel primed for Satuday!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-09-28	3:33 PM	Run	Easy	6.02	Mile	0:41:18													Nice run on the Lafayette side of the Wabash Heritage Trail. Very dope, riverside trail, awesome paved little path with no traffic or people.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-09-29	10:44 AM	Run	Easy	1.11	Mile	0:8:05													Cooldown after the race.<br><br>Really solid until the 4th mile, would have liked that to be at least 10 seconds faster with a better kick. Started making moves after the second mile but should have been the third with Quanch and Paul. Great day though, and didn't feel fatigued just not 100% on my game, but good race!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-09-30	4:54 PM	Run	Long	12.07	Mile	1:25:26													Nice easy long run on left river, the trail is beautiful! Wish my legs weren't so tired and sore, got pretty slammed at 8-10 miles and had to stop after the hill up the power plant. Between bad sleep, little water, and many juul hits, I'd say 12 miles was a bit too much today, but I can chill out the first few days of next week and be fine.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-01	4:49 PM	Run	Easy	7.90	Mile	0:54:27													Left trail again with some guys, felt like I was always on the verge of feeling really bad but stayed with it! Hopefully tomorrow is good.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-10-02	6:06 PM	Run	Easy	1.08	Mile	0:8:00													Cooldown after the workout.<br><br>Pretty solid times here, 3/4 past days have been really good work days and this will probably be my last until the long run Sunday. Planned on stopping at the 5th rep, then did the 6th at "six minutes" but the guys had other ideas in mind. Felt good!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-10-03	4:48 PM	Run	Easy	7.70	Mile	0:55:23													Nice run out to the bog with two loops in the forest, felt solid pace but you know, the forest fucks the gps. Good recovery day though regardless. 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-04	3:58 PM	Run	Easy	8.15	Mile	0:54:48													Speedboat run on my own before the chem exam, went a slightly extended lagoon run and it was alright. Surprisingly cold for high 60's, wind was sharp.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-05	11:14 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:48:26													Fun little night run back in B-Town, recovering nicely from festivities and all the work in the past week. 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-06	9:49 PM	Run	Easy	8.07	Mile	0:54:25													Slightly less late run, went a lot faster and felt pretty good, the rolling hills of southern Indiana got to me a bit in the middle but finished without getting mugged or hit.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-07	12:51 PM	Run	Long	11.42	Mile	1:16:04													Hot ass bitch of a run, felt great until about 8-9 miles and I fell apart pretty quickly after that. The pace and the heat got to me pretty hard I'd say, but not a bad way to cap off the most mileage I've done in a week in probably 9 months. Next week I'll up above 60 with some good workouts, an easier long run, and an even bigger ego. 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-08	8:56 AM	Run	Easy	7.03	Mile	0:51:57													Easy, EASY run with the boys on Karst Farm. Sore as shit but makes it for a good easy day.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-10-09	6:04 PM	Run	Easy	1.10	Mile	0:8:14													Cooldown after the workout. Felt pretty good on the workout, the course was muddy and my legs didn't feel great on the warmup but I kept up with it and finished it even though I was by myself on the later half. Also my first workout since last Tuesday so it was a good way to get back into it.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-10-10	4:47 PM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:56:14													Easy run down to the hollow, down River road to the power plant, through PVIL, back to co-rec. Started off at a slower pace and felt good, picked it up with some uphill and felt a bit sore but overall feel great after yesterday's workout. 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-11	4:51 PM	Run	Easy	8.06	Mile	0:55:08													Nice "aesthetic" run with Paul, 53 degrees out and windy as hell, felt very cold but very good! I forgot how easy running feels when it's cold out, even just barely like today. Definitely ready for a solid workout tomorrow.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-10-12	5:54 PM	Run	Easy	1.90	Mile	0:13:40													Cooldown after the workout. Surprisingly beat all of Group 2 in the workout towards the end, kicked decently hard on the last one and beat everyone by a good margin. Times were slow but with the snow, water, mud, cold, and shitty course, I'd say these times were pretty solid, probably comparable to 3:20's on the track (I hope). Definitely a good mental workout if nothing else!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-10-13	4:27 PM	Run	Easy	8.18	Mile	0:57:48													Nice recovery day after the workout. Went down to the Bog with Paul, ran into a swamp and turned back around. Amazing weather, 53ish degrees and sunny with no wind. Felt great!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-14	1:38 PM	Run	Long	13.10	Mile	1:29:28													Super chill long run, FIRST 13 mile run since January, FIRST 60+ mile week since January, and haven't felt this good on a long run in awhile! Went down left river, almost to the Davis Ferry park, but decided I'll save that secret for a 14 mile run. The trail was a little muddy, some pretty big puddles, but still a lot of fun. Feeling very ready for regionals next week!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-15	4:48 PM	Run	Easy	8.25	Mile	0:56:33													Solid distance run by Walmart to Salisbury, back to the Corec and then back to PVIL. Picked it up to 6:40 and that felt annoyingly quick but whatever, I'll feel good for the workout tomorrow and hopefully just won't take it too hard.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-16	4:38 PM	Run	Easy	2.01	Mile	0:13:59													Warmup for the workout, started the run from PVIL.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2018-10-16	5:55 PM	Run	Easy	1.83	Mile	0:13:30													Cooldown after the workout, definitely feeling all the speed but I'm happy how it went. It feels good to let loose on the track for the first time in awhile, and with the race 4 days away I'm confident I can rest appropriately.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-10-17	12:51 PM	Run	Easy	8.03	Mile	0:57:41													Solo run all over the place, windy as fuck but whatever. Definitely feeling the workout from yesterday but the pace felt relaxed so I'm happy.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-18	3:50 PM	Run	Easy	7.06	Mile	0:49:14													Another nice and easy distance run before Saturday, this time went aesthetic route and it was nice. The hills were pretty tough and I'm still definitely sore from Tuesday but I'm still confident in my recovery abilities.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-19	4:07 PM	Run	Easy	6.01	Mile	0:41:04													Solid run before the meet tomorrow, went out to the bike trail and back. Small pick up at the end, a few strides, and I feel ready.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-10-20	3:44 PM	Run	Easy	4.30	Mile	0:29:17													Nice lil steamboat run<br><br>Real fuckin rough race, little to no warm up, foot hurt very bad, wind fucked my head up, not at all what I wanted from this race. I guess I have nationals now to look forward to, and another few weeks of good training. Literally nothing to lose at this point, can’t get worse than this!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-10-21	1:38 PM	Run	Long	14.15	Mile	1:34:57													Pretty nice long run on left river again, a bit fast cuz i'm still salty about yesterday. Definitely could not go very fast on the trail today because of all the sticks, terrain, and gps-fuckage, but I did make it out to the bridge! Pretty boring and ugly honestly, and because of the pace fuckery I'll probably not run there for awhile. <br><br>Pushed fairly hard the last few miles 6:40/6:32/6:34/6:39/6:31 and held it surprisingly well, that's probably the best finish to a long run this far I've had in a long time. My goal with long runs is to keep upping the distance per week and hopefully get to a 16 or 17 mile run, then go for a half marathon PR sometime. Pretty happy with my progress so far, haven't ran 14 miles in almost 2 years, and the pace just gets easier and easier.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-22	4:42 PM	Run	Easy	8.22	Mile	0:57:11													Nice aesthetic run, the girls were too fast for us so we slowed it down. Surprisingly not dead after the long run yesterday, although the hills are always hard.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-23	10:08 PM	Run	Easy	8.20	Mile	0:55:45													2 campus loops and a mini loop at PVIL at NIGHT after a bio exam. Felt pretty solid, just tried to run how I feel without looking at the watch				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-10-24	6:54 PM	Run	Easy	2.63	Mile	0:18:59													Cooldown half on the course and back to PVIL. Workout felt really good! Tempo was comfortably hard the whole way through, and I was getting some good turnover on the 400s afterwards. Very solid workout, definitely should take an easy 7:15 pace day tomorrow with all the mileage and work I'm doing lately.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-10-25	6:13 PM	Run	Easy	8.11	Mile	0:57:59													Nice Lagoon Loop, took an easy day after the workout yesterday and for the workout tomorrow.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-10-26	5:43 PM	Run	Easy	4.40	Mile	0:32:49													Easy mileage during the workout and cooldown afterwards.<br><br>Really solid workout! Probably wore too many clothes, I thought it would be a lot colder with the rain but it really wasn't. Started the workout pretty hard and got a little bit faster each time so I'm happy! Definitely very tired from all the mileage after the workout but I have lots of easy days coming up, I'll try to take the long run easy this Sunday and just focus on hitting the goal mileage. Good day!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-10-27	11:15 PM	Run	Easy	6.01	Mile	0:42:22													Very nice easy run, very nice and sore from yesterday. A bit late out for my tastes but it's what Halloweekend calls for.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-10-28	10:46 PM	Run	Long	15.21	Mile	1:43:18													I am Jesus incarnate<br><br>But really, DOPE long run at god damn midnight after a very hard week in terms of workouts and mileage, the hardest I've had in probably a year. I literally haven't had this type of production in a long time, if ever, and I don't know how much longer I can hold it, the goal is at least one more week.<br><br>Started at PVIL, out and back on State street to 231, to the acres, to Northwestern, down State street until I took a left on Jische, another left onto Harrison, down the two hills, a right on River, then back to PVIL which was 7.5 exactly and then did it again. Definitely mind numbing on the second loop but I held on really well up the hills on the second loop and finished with a 6:43 and a 6:33 on my last two miles. Not as fast as my first 15 mile long run, which was 6:42 pace, but I'm still very proud of this run, and it is officially my longest run.<br><br>Looking back on my training throughout the past few months, I really am very pleased with how far I've come. Having started with a summer of very little running, to a rough first month back to running everyday, to coming very, very near the best endurance shape of my life, it's been a wild journey. I think it has definitely rejuvenated my passion for running and has reminded me why I run, which is to run far and run my heart out on my own terms, which I never quite had in high school. I'm not done quite yet with Cross Country, and I have a few more difficult weeks ahead of me, but I'm already excited for my first full season in run club with track. I think I can really make an impact.<br><br>Onto my 70 mile week.  				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

Kept up with the back end of group 1, couldn't really go any faster after the 1000 as I probably tried my hardest on that one. Felt really good to go fast again though, it's been a long time. Tried to keep shoulders down and good arm drive down the stretch but it got pretty tough.<br><br>				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-10-31	5:26 PM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:54:18													Felt like shit today and didn't even know if i wanted to run but I went for it. Went the full aesthetic loop and felt surprisingly good, the hills weren't even too bad. Weather was pretty shit, cold, windy, and drizzly, which just added to my daily depression, but great pace given yesterday's workout and my persistent sickness since Sunday's long run. I'll probably chill out tomorrow, see if I can double at all without dying.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-12	4:33 PM	Run	Easy	6.10	Mile	0:41:20													First run back since the Black Death, could definitely tell I'm still in decent shape because the pace was solid and I felt pretty much the same as before the break, a little sore towards the end but that's all. Definitely pretty happy with this, only 153 days left until Track Nationals? Easy shit				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-13	4:44 PM	Run	Easy	6.01	Mile	0:40:56													Little run down on right river and back. Felt decent again, a little spent towards the end but it was uphill. I should probably slow it down for the next few days, I've got many more months to spend myself.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-14	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	7.27	Mile	0:49:54													Walmart Loop starting from PVIL, ended up being way longer than I anticipated so I had to B-Line back to PVIL, running across lawns and shit. Pace felt better today, and it didn't seem as cold. Definitely already getting very excited for track and what it could look like given how fast my start is going to be here, granted the season is 6 weeks shorter, although those 6 weeks never did much for me anyways.

2018-11-15	8:04 PM	Run	Easy	6.03	Mile	0:41:37													Nice late-night campus loop after my calc test. Roads were a little slushy but nothing I couldn't handle. Legs were sore but this is the best I've felt past couple of days fitness wise!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-16	5:20 PM	Run	Easy	7.37	Mile	0:50:51													Reverse happy hollow run, surprisingly hilly on the trail but still held good pace.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-21	11:09 AM	Run	Easy	7.25	Mile	0:49:41													Fun run with Isaac on a shortened flower run, hills and talking definitely made me feel fat and out of shape. But obviously, I am not ;)				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-11-23	8:39 AM	Run	Easy	7.14	Mile	0:51:26													"fun" run with iSaac and Nathaniel down to B-Line and back, I swear this town gets hillier everytime I run through it				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-24	3:12 PM	Run	Easy	7.11	Mile	0:47:50													Surprisingly speedy little run in the hood, still sore as fuck but at least was 55 degrees outside!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-25	4:20 PM	Run	Long	11.06	Mile	1:15:42													Relaxing long run back in the Due, did the Cumberland loop. Pretty windy and not very sunny but still about 50 degrees so it was nice out. Good first long run back!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-26	5:02 PM	Run	Easy	8.09	Mile	0:55:39													Cold ass, windy ass, icy ass run. Did a loop on the highway, to Walmart, then cut through campus back to PVIL. Not too bad except it got dark at the end, the elements were against me.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-27	4:34 PM	Run	Easy	8.05	Mile	0:56:46													Tried to run down left river but it was flooded as fuck so had to some weird annoying loop, another cold and cloudy day.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-28	1:19 PM	Run	Easy	8.03	Mile	0:53:01													Did a loop on the highway to the bike trail and back. Surprisingly fast, my legs were pretty heavy but breathing felt fine besides a little bit of coughing. Very cold still but the sun was out and very little wind so it was a nice break!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-11-29	4:39 PM	Run	Easy	8.11	Mile	0:54:57													Run down to Happy Hollow, really nice day outside at 40 degrees and no wind! Felt good despite a fast run yesterday, but don't wanna push it too hard.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-12-01	4:34 PM	Run	Easy	8.05	Mile	0:54:53													Very warm outside today, did a lagoon loop and felt really good. I wish I ran yesterday, but hopefully I can run everyday of December and put in really solid mileage. Feeling good and motivated.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-12-02	1:51 PM	Run	Long	12.19	Mile	1:22:33													Cumberland to REVERSE Happy Hollow, which was a big mistake because it actually is 0.75 of straight uphill. I actually had to stop to catch my breath for a minute, but I finished the run just fine! Good pace overall, kind of a shit day but oh well.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-12-03	4:53 PM	Run	Easy	8.04	Mile	0:55:41													Nice easy run down to Lafeyette and back. First day of my "Week of Exploring Lafyette: An Adventure in Shitland". Basically ran through a trailer park for a few miles and came back, but I'm sure I can find at least one non shitty route in a week of running there.

2018-12-04	4:50 PM	Run	Easy	2.23	Mile	0:15:31													Warmup and cooldown mileage from the fartlek. Pretty solid first winter workout, traffic got in the way a little bit but what are you gonna do. Pretty dreary day, wet and cloudy per usual, but you can't stop the grind. The goal of the workout was to get tempo-like work in with some rest, and this was a fun way to do it. Felt really good the whole way, and a little tired at the end so I knew it was working. I'd like to do a tempo sometime later this week if my legs are up for it.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2018-12-05		Run	Easy	7.07	Mile	0:47:19													First run with the club in awhile and probably my last because they run like idiots, 5 miles at 6:30 pace. Not for me, chief. Got the best hair award though, not surprised, really just hitting my expectations at this point.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-12-06	4:44 PM	Run	Easy	8.36	Mile	0:57:44													Slippery slope of a run, ran around like a madman and had to run slow so I didn't die. Got my mileage though.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00

2018-12-07	5:19 PM	Run	Easy	3.26	Mile	0:22:36													Some mileage after the run. Actually very happy with how the tempo went, the last 3 or 4 minutes were pretty rough but with the pace I was going at i'm not surprised. Didn't have to stop once for cars or anything which was nice, and I was happy to be getting faster each mile! Probably could have done 25 minutes but I'll save it for next week.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-12-08	4:49 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:54:05													Surprisingly solid distance run after a late night and a tempo run the day before. Did the 231-Bike trail loop, felt fast and furious.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-09	1:38 PM	Run	Long	13.10	Mile	1:28:46													Decent long run on a 231-Cumberland-Happy Hollow route. Felt kind of shitty the whole time, not really sure why because I held a decent pace the entire time and my breathing never got out of hand. I might just be sore and a little dehydrated. <br><br>All around amazing week though, lots of good distance runs, two solid workouts, a good long run, and 60 miles for the week. I've been feeling really pumped and motivated about running lately, hopefully it stays and this training is put to good use soon!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-12-10	8:19 PM	Run	Easy	8.09	Mile	0:57:25													Easy fun run in the dark with Michael. Definitely pretty sore from last week, I think I had a lot of energy from all the breaks I took and I'm starting to feel it, but it means I'm getting in even better shape.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-11	4:06 PM	Run	Easy	2.82	Mile	0:19:26													Warmup and cool down from the fartlek.  <br><br>Overall pretty good workout, started to feel pretty tight around the last few reps. Actually less total time than last week and just a bit more mileage, I think I was a tad bit slower but that's fine given the intervals were more difficult, especially with that 4-5-4 combo. I might change my tempo workout this week because I didn't feel all that great today, we'll see how the next few days go. Good work today!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2018-12-12	5:02 PM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:55:24													Nice little run down in the shitty town of Lafayette. Made it out to the cross country club, dope little trail behind it, might look into it for a long/longer run. Smelled pretty bad most of the time, pretty dark, hilly as fuck. Good mileage though after a good workout yesterday. Already have more miles this month than all of November, i no longer feel fat.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-13	5:07 PM	Run	Easy	8.09	Mile	0:55:44													Shitty  weather run, legs felt kind of like jello but I think that's from all the hills yesterday. Good, solid mileage.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2018-12-14	3:17 PM	Run	Easy	2.06	Mile	0:14:48													Cooldown after the workout. Honestly pretty sore and tired from this one, I was hoping I could handle it better. I think I've just been putting in too much work these past few weeks, especially after a very mileage empty November. Although I'm going to try to hit 70 these next few weeks, I definitely need some more easy days, maybe even else workouts.<br><br>With that being said, this was still a very good workout! I'm happy with 4 miles at 5:37 pace, it's exactly what I wanted from today. This is a very good start to hopefully my best track season yet.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-12-15	7:25 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:58:00													Post final easy run, kind of lame because my watch shit out around like 2 miles so I'm guessing the distance a tad bit but this seems fair enough. I've decided to make Saturdays my designated easy days where I just go purely based off feel, 10-20 seconds slower than normal without looking at my pace for pace. I think this will be a good way to have a "day off" and still get the mileage I want, keeping my mind AND my body happy.<br><br>Probably my last run in Purdue Village so it's bittersweet. Of course it was dark and a little bit windy out, I'll miss some of this for sure.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-16	4:21 PM	Run	Long	13.10	Mile	1:29:51													First day back in the hood, and you know what I do? I go down the gravel hill. It's like I have yet to learn that when you go down the hill, you often have to go back up. I found that out the hard way with a 7:11 mile split after going 9 minute pace for a damn quarter mile up that hill. I actually can't believe I made it all the way up, I was dead halfway. Definitely very sore now but it was a solid run, and I'm happy to be home!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-12-17	9:13 AM	Run	Easy	7.02	Mile	0:46:55													Fast as shit run with Isaac, Andy, and Miles. Definitely didn't want to do this a day after my long run but oh well. Because I only got 7 I'll try to do a double tonight, if not no biggie.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-12-18	4:49 PM	Run	Easy	8.14	Mile	0:55:56													Nice run in the hood, still pretty sore from all the recent hills, and my knee felt like it was getting pulled on a bit but otherwise felt fine. 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00

2018-12-20	3:15 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:48:13													Random spurts of running and frisbee after watching the guy's run their mile time trial. It wasn't an easy day per say but I'll count it as one.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2018-12-21	4:45 PM	Run	Easy	8.32	Mile	0:55:37													Ran right at 4:45 today, so beautiful, unlike the weather which was pure shit. Still cranked out some good mileage even though I wasn't feelin it at first.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-22	4:49 PM	Run	Easy	8.30	Mile	0:57:26													Basically the same day as yesterday, just slower and felt a little worse, probably just tired from yesterday. Nicer day outside though.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-23	4:10 PM	Run	Long	13.20	Mile	1:28:49													First run down to lost man's lane and MY GOD it is a hilly bitch! Ended up going to shadowwood instead of union valley because it seemed way less hilly. Had to do an extra loop around north but that was no big deal. Pace was surprisingly good despite all the hills and kind of a bleh week, but I think I'll be good for some solid workouts next week to finish off perhaps my strongest December yet!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-24	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	8.06	Mile	0:55:16													Parked at K-Mart (rest in peace) and did a loop from the bypass, down to Walnut, and back on third street. Felt pretty good actually, not at all sick or sore from yesterday. 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-25	3:52 PM	Run	Easy	8.12	Mile	0:55:23													Early, sunny, Christmas run with a new 235! Pretty dope watch I gotta say. Didn't feel great today, haven't had a whole lot of water or food though. Still a nice run with some sun.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00

2018-12-26	5:11 PM	Run	Easy	2.76	Mile	0:20:18													Cooldown after the workout with the easy 800 jog inbetween the 5k and 300s.<br><br>The tempo 5k was harder than I thought it would be, but it's the midsummer course and I'm but a flat earther from Lafayette. The 300's weren't too bad, probably could have done a few more but I didn't want to push it given I haven't done speed in months.<br><br>This workout, while very solid, showed me just how slow, not out of shape, but slow I am. Granted I'm never slow, I can kick ass in anything above a 1600, but man I am not in the best shape of my life quite yet. I mean this is a good thing since it's still December, I have 4 solid months left to train for nationals, and it's probably best I'm not even close to peaking. What it does mean is that I have a lot more work to do than I previously thought. Once school starts up again, I really gotta focus on workouts and beating people. I've had it pretty easy this past month, 60 miles or not, but this month truly has just been base conditioning. <br><br>With all that depressing stuff being said, this workout was a step in the right direction. Not only to set my mind straight but to get my body on track. I wouldn't have been doing shit like this a year ago, four and half miles of HARD WORK by myself after a week of feeling kind of sick and after a month of 60 miles every week. I have a lot to be proud of still, and this is LITERALLY just the beginning. Buckle up buckaroos!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-12-27	4:15 PM	Run	Easy	8.12	Mile	0:56:33													Easily my least favorite run of break. Fuck wind, fuck rain, fuck cold, fuck cars, and FUCK 12<br><br>and fuck the poo plant hill. Gotta love the beautiful valley under but still, fuck it. Pretty tired from yesterday's workout which is a good sign, I'll take it. Can't beat myself up too much if I'm slow the next day.

2018-12-28	4:24 PM	Run	Easy	8.03	Mile	0:54:24													Felt much better than yesterday, legs got really tight around 4 miles but better from then on. The weather didn't shit on me the whole time so that was nice.<br><br>Also going to start doing some exercises 3-4 times a week in the pursuit of gaining muscles i've never had before.

2018-12-29	5:25 PM	Run	Easy	1.30	Mile	0:9:21													Cooldown after the workout.<br><br>A very solid fartlek, definitely the hardest one I've done so far. Legs were sore from the beginning just because of how tough the past few weeks have been but I finished stronger than I started. I probably could have spent a little more in the beginning but thats fine, I'd rather have a fast ending than beginning.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2018-12-30	3:49 PM	Run	Long	13.24	Mile	1:30:21													Almost shit my pants like twice, got made fun of by some kids, and my legs were sore the entire time. It was a damn good long run.<br><br>Started at north, went down Walnut, back up the B-Line, then a 2 mile loop around north to finish. I wanted to avoid as many hills as possible, and I think it worked pretty well. The Arlington hill didn't give me too much trouble, but my GOD the big midsummer hill LITERALLY almost made me shit my pants. I mean I've never experienced bowel control loss like that. My stomach was kind of upset the whole run, but I didn't see this one coming. Thanks to whatever higher power exists in this universe, my brand new flamingo shorts were totally fine.<br><br>I got roasted by some little kid in the ghetto, he said "Ay, why you got on GIRL shorts? HAH" next to all his little friends. I was honestly too tired and oxygen deprived to think of a witty, PG response. Better than getting shot I guess.<br><br>Overall this is hands down one of the best training weeks I've had all year. Great mileage, great workouts, good distance runs, didn't shit my pants even once. Best way to end perhaps the most tumultuous year of running I've had since I started. With that being said, I am REALLY looking forward to a down week next week. No way in hell I could keep this up for much longer. 				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2018-12-31	4:47 PM	Run	Easy	8.30	Mile	0:58:42													NICE recovery flower run, or so I hope. Felt like a turtle the first few miles, especially up hills (which is the whole run who am I kidding?) but I felt progressively better as the run continued which hopefully means good things for tomorrow! Also it was 60 degrees out, but the wetness and windy ruined that fun just a little bit. Still great.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00

2019-01-02	4:17 PM	Run	Easy	8.08	Mile	0:52:52													A small progression run of sorts I guess, last three miles were 6:34/6:23/5:55<br>Honestly was just planning an easy run but my body really wanted to go fast so I went out the last mile. Felt good though, definitely recovered from last week.. just to turn around and probably not run during this conference. I mean its only a few days so it's no big deal but it is just a little bit annoying. Oh well, the time off is probably for the best. I'm still in a reaaaally good place. Very excited for the next meet!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00

Just going to do 7 everyday this week with a long run after my midyear break. Glad I took that break though, I think it was definitely needed after a very hard December. <br><br>I am EXTREMELY excited to get back to working out and racing though, I may not feel like it yet but I am on the cusp of feeling very good and doing some very cool things. I truly believe come February/March I will be a beast. Here we fucking go				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00

2019-01-08	5:32 PM	Run	Easy	2.85	Mile	0:20:17													Cooldown after the workout. Honestly pretty easy workout, a lot faster than stuff I was doing over break but MUCH shorter too. That's kind of what I wanted though, I've got a really good base going into the fast stuff now. I'm still a little rusty after my 4 day break but the rest of the week is just easy mileage so I have time to acclimate. And my weekly mileage will still be pretty solid, probably keep 55-60 miles a week for now and just focus on feeling good for/after workouts.<br><br>Ran with the top group for the whole fartlek, not sure if I'm in really good shape, trying too hard, or everyone else just sucks for now. Oh well, race in two weeks. I know what I need to do to be successful and I think today was a good first step, regardless of what other people say or think.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2019-01-13	3:25 PM	Run	Long	10.24	Mile	1:07:12													Felt really good today! Even after a 5:00 am bedtime, my body can pull this out of the void on a slushy day. Did some weird loops around campus on whatever sidewalks were available. I think my body was just angry that it was such an easy week. Workouts look a lot better this week though so I'm definitely excited to show off what I have.<br><br>50ish miles definitely is a good place to stay for awhile I think, mileage won't be as important since we need a lot of speed at this point. Although I didn't have a grand buildup like I usually do in the winter, I think I'll just go for consistent mileage this season and focus on workouts/races.

2019-01-14	2:49 PM	Run	Easy	7.23	Mile	0:49:07													Solid distance run after a really good long run. Went down state street, back to PVIL, down harrison, then back.

2019-01-15	9:09 PM	Run	Easy	1.57	Mile	0:12:04													REALLY NICE WORKOUT! This was a lot of fun, being near the top of group one in a very difficult workout. Really started to feel it towards the end of the 4x400, the last 400 bust of 66 felt like a sub 60. This is so much speed at once since I haven't done any in months, but I hung in well.<br><br>Calves cramped like a motherfucker immediately after my cooldown on the track, but after some water I was fine in 5 minutes. I'll definitely need some recovery days after this but it was well worth it. Very pumped to see what the race in a few weeks has in store for me. 				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2019-01-18	5:40 PM	Run	Easy	2.01	Mile	0:14:57													Cooldown after the tempo.<br><br>Felt surprisingly good! Definitely still sore from Tuesday, but I wasn't at all tired. Honestly could have started off 10 seconds faster the first mile and held it from there. The kick was probably a little too much, but Sidd left the group we were in and I went with him. Had a lot more fun with it then I thought I would, probably just because I felt so good. <br><br>Overall really awesome workouts this week! And I'm not just saying that, I honestly don't think I could have showed up any better than I did. I really proved myself and I can't wait for the race next week! I might be able to say, for the first time in about a year, I am in the best shape of my life. Only have to wait one more week to see if it's true.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

Thankfully I had Sidd to share some pain with me and Tyler a bit over from us. Went by pretty fast actually and I didn't feel that bad, just very boring and I wish it wasn't so icy outside.<br><br>Overall great week! Mileage is about the same as last week, but with all the snow and what not I really can't be mad. The two workouts were amazing as well, and I can already tell I'm recovering very nicely from both of them. Onto race week.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00								
2019-01-21	5:51 PM	Run	Easy	7.07	Mile	0:49:37													Real bitch of a run with all the ice and shit on the Walmart loop, but it was nice going with Michael.

2019-01-25	5:06 PM	Run	Easy	6.92	Mile	0:47:45													A nice little pre-meet run, did 6 strides about 2 miles into the run (after realizing the bike trail was still fucked). Legs didn't feel amazing, but I mean it was like 10 degrees out and I had my mask on almost the whole time. I'll be good for tomorrow.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00

2019-01-26	2:57 PM	Run	Easy	2.15	Mile	0:15:17													Cooldown after all the stuff.<br><br>Honestly not that bad of a race, the fastest time on the team was like a 9:13... so I'd say 9:15 was a stretch on my part. However, had my seed time been a 9:20, a mere 5 seconds slower, I would have been in a heat with actual competition instead of no man's land, and I think I could have very feasibly ran 8-10 seconds faster. It's a damn shame this had to happen, but I least I know where I stand. It just so happens to be a bit slower than what I thought I could achieve. No worries though, plenty more races to strut my stuff!				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2019-01-27	4:04 PM	Run	Long	11.07	Mile	1:14:50													3 campus loops for the long run, actually a nice day for it being 10 degrees. No wind, little ice, and campus was pretty empty. Legs felt pretty good after a rough day yesterday, I think it was just nerves and being in a bad heat. Great week though!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v2	85.00

A textbook case of a boot and rally I'd say, felt amazing today after a really solid tempo yesterday. The sun was out, my legs were out, and I was only wearing one shirt. Felt like an actual run.<br><br>Overall solid week, the workout on Tuesday, indoor running Wednesday, and slow run on Thursday left me wanting more, but I think I did the best with how god damn cold it was this week. Temperatures will get better and I plan to start doing my own workouts for awhile. As long as my body keeps up with this, I think I'm in for some good times in just a few weeks.

Definitely felt it afterwards though, it was the most volume I've had in a long time for sure, just not very quick. It was a good confidence booster after being sick and not running as much as I want to, and it was probably just enough given I haven't worked out this hard in a few weeks.

I only went three minutes longer than last time, but the pace was slightly faster and I was running into the wind the first half of the run, which really sucked. <br><br>A half mile longer than last time though is something to be happy about, I'll shoot for 26 minutes next time! 				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88

2019-05-26	7:26 PM	Run	Long	11.01	Mile	1:15:43													BEAUTIFUL long run on the B-Line to Bypass loop, truly a mystic experience. Had a few people honk and holler, got called a faggot which I was basically asking for when I was on high traffic streets for that long. Found a porta potty right has I started to feel some i n t e r n a l  p r e s s u r e and I must say it was a gift from Mingus himself.

2019-05-27	8:36 AM	Run	Easy	7.07	Mile	0:47:30													Another speedy run with Isaac, ran down Bales and up 17th street.

2019-06-07	7:59 PM	Run	Easy	8.12	Mile	0:55:28													Day 2 of what the fuck is my body, felt like I was on a bad trip the whole time. Couldn't go up a hill to save my life (I found out after going down the gravel hill) so I just stayed on flat ground and walking up the gravel hill. Good pace, got the mileage in, but very unfulfilling.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v3	80.00

Had some fairly big hills to tackle and my legs held up just fine, didn't tire out at the end either. I think Cascades repeats are already starting to help me out!

2019-06-16	8:08 AM	Run	Long	13.13	Mile	1:29:08													First 13 mile run in a long time! Went on the fairly hilly Vernal Pike trail for an out and back, almost made it out to Karst. Legs felt a little rough, but man handled the last three miles like it was nothing, closed in a 6:26. Definitely needed a run like this after the disappointment that was yesterday, and after not having a long run last week.<br><br>I think it's important to remember this is my first true base building in 18 months, and i've made really solid progress so far. It's only the middle of June! I have another 2 and a half months before any sort of season rolls around and I'm already at 60 miles. Despite a setback here and there, this is shaping up to be my best off season yet.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v3	80.00								
2019-06-17	9:06 AM	Run	Easy	8.09	Mile	0:56:58													Excellent recovery day, legs felt pretty solid. Went down third street to Walnut and back on the Bypass.

2019-06-18	10:26 AM	Run	Easy	0.84	Mile	0:6:35													Really solid work day! Another 6 minutes of fartlek and another Cascades repeat, handled it even better than last week! The fartlek wasn't quite as fast but it was rather humid out. Just wanted to focus on feeling good though since there's a tempo scheduled on Friday.				adidas	Boston 6	9.50	US/Canada		84.88								
2019-06-19	9:02 AM	Run	Easy	8.04	Mile	0:57:37													Pretty rough recovery run at rail trail, between being tired, stressed, and the humidity, this was not cut out to be a great day. Still chugged along though and finished, hopefully tomorrow is better.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v3	80.00								
2019-06-20	8:55 AM	Run	Easy	8.07	Mile	0:54:03													EXCELLENT Sare out and back, first run in the 35's! Feet were a little sore on the way out but felt fine on the way back. 30 seconds faster on average per mile than yesterday so I'd say today was a good rebound.

2019-06-21	10:08 AM	Run	Easy	2.64	Mile	0:18:47													Cooldown from the tempo.<br><br>This is an incredible tempo after taking a break from them for awhile! Felt amazing starting out, definitely started to feel rough around the turn around point and was definitely slowing down a bit towards the end, but 25 minutes is no joke! Managed a 17:30 5k split too, I could definitely race a solid 5k right now on the roads. Excited for the next tempo!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2019-06-22	1:42 PM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:54:58													Ran late today because of the morning rain, did a hillside-3rd street loop. Was feeling the humidity on the way back and my shoes were bothering my feet, but not a bad run given the work yesterday.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-06-23	9:25 AM	Run	Long	14.19	Mile	1:35:40													WOOF! Meant to go 13 today but I messed up the route, went down Bayles and Cascades to 17th, then the Bypass until Hillside, then to Walnut and back up Rogers to North. It actually went by super fast, Isaac was there too. Really solid pace though, even with 762 feet of elevation gain!<br><br>Overall this week is probably the best week I've had in over a year! Two awesome workouts, every distance run had it's purpose, and the long run was outstanding. The best part is I feel great! A little tired, but no aches or pains, which is incredible. And it's still June..				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v3	80.00								
2019-06-24	9:07 AM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:56:34													Really smooth easy run after yesterday's blowout of a long run, definitely very sore and tight but the pace was just right. Went down 3rd street, back on 10th, down smith, back on clarizz. Just barely escaped the rain.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99

2019-06-25	9:23 AM	Run	Easy	0.83	Mile	0:6:33													Cooldown after the workout.<br><br>Really solid day! Was afraid the long run would make me a little tired, and I think it did somewhat, but 25 minutes at 6 minute pace (at Cascades with gps fuckery and mud) and SIX times up Cascades is nothing to laugh at. Another really good Tuesday workout!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2019-06-26	8:08 AM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:57:47													Nice and easy recovery at rails to trails.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-06-27	8:12 AM	Run	Easy	8.08	Mile	0:56:19													Was able to go a bit faster today, hamstrings felt really sore but I think that's mostly from working outside the past two days. Did a 17th loop with all the boys, then a small out and back on Kinser with Isaac.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-06-27	5:52 PM	Run	Easy	3.07	Mile	0:21:36													Easy shakeout run, 87 degrees but that can't stop me. Hamstrings still a little tight but actually felt good otherwise!				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v3	80.00

2019-06-28	8:36 AM	Run	Easy	2.17	Mile	0:15:53													Cooldown after the workout.<br><br>Went 0.02 farther than last week! Actually felt much better at the end too, this run followed a slight progression and managed to stay strong at the end. Still felt tired on the way back, but I was more proud of myself this time. Dope day.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2019-06-29	6:34 AM	Run	Easy	8.07	Mile	0:55:43													EARLY morning run, it was nice not having the sun and heat though. Legs felt really bad the first 3 or 4 miles, but after that it was cruise town, even with some nasty up and downs after Olcott.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-06-30	8:04 PM	Run	Long	14.04	Mile	1:36:01													Late night long run, felt really good actually, took it at a really nice pace. Legs were hurting the last mile going up the Kinser hills, but that's to be expected. Great ending to a great week!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-01	7:40 AM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:55:30													Felt pretty tired today, this made for about 22 miles in the past 12 hours. Legs were sore going up hills, but hey got the mileage in.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99

2019-07-02	9:01 AM	Run	Easy	1.00	Mile	0:7:45													Cooldown after the workout.<br><br>This was my first disappointing workout of the summer I would say. It's ambitious to think I can keep upping the fartlek and hill repeats, but I kept doing it without a problem. I thought by making the fartlek reps easier, and going slower, would help me feel good for the hills, but I blew up on the third one, barely making it to the sign at the top.<br><br>I'd say doing my long run at 8 pm, which I felt great on, and then running 12 hours later too fast with the group, that's what got me. I should have taken Monday slow on my own, knowing that running that soon after 14 miles was bound to hurt me. <br><br>Whatever the case may be, while this was disappointing, it's not a step back. I just need a few days to re calibrate my legs and get into a good groove again. I still want to hit 70 miles, even if it's my slowest week yet. I think the pain now will only help me later in following weeks.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2019-07-03	7:39 AM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:58:28													Easy run with los chicos at Rail to Trail. Legs felt dead as expected, and the slow pace didn't do much to remedy them. Still a good run!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-04	8:27 AM	Run	Easy	8.04	Mile	0:55:53													BEAUTIFUL easy run, felt much better than yesterday on a much sunnier and hillier route. This is the kind of bounce back I sorely needed. Went solo today on a 3rd street bypass loop. The bypass was a pace buster like usual, but my spirits are still high.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-04	5:07 PM	Run	Easy	3.18	Mile	0:22:20													Ez money double, even if the heat index is 98 lol. Still felt pretty good, heat hit me fo shizzle but can't stop this machine.				Nike	Pegasus 34	9.00	US/Canada	v3	80.00								
2019-07-05	7:38 AM	Run	Easy	9.01	Mile	1:04:54													Had a tempo slated for today and instead had a slow easy run. A little disappointing, but at the same time I'm not surprised after Tuesday. I'm still feeling good about myself and this week and I think it's important to stay happy and optimistic no matter how I feel. One missed workout won't make or break me, especially in July, mileage is still the most important thing right now.<br><br>For what it's worth, I felt much better today than I did yesterday and my heart rate showed that, however I did go a lot slower today than yesterday. Not sure why, just felt like the right thing to do. The double might have wore me out more than anticipated. The double I do tomorrow will be a lot slower for sure.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2019-07-06	8:37 AM	Run	Easy	8.04	Mile	0:54:59													Decent run, pushed the pace to remind myself I'm not COMPLETE shit after this week. But of course, the dew point was 74 so I felt like I was running in a pool. I can't seem to catch a break can I?				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-07	8:40 AM	Run	Long	6.00	Mile	0:43:06													Woof				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-10	10:26 AM	Run	Easy	7.16	Mile	0:50:40													First run back from the fatigue, and I must say I feel much better! Legs and shins were a little tight and stiff but that's to be expected. Ran down lakeside pretty boring but oh well.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-11	8:26 AM	Run	Easy	8.08	Mile	0:56:15													Second run back, felt even better today! Legs tightened up a bit after six miles but I just figure I'm getting back into it. Went down lakeSHORE today and it was way nicer, tons of shade and pretty houses to look at.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-12	9:55 AM	Run	Easy	8.14	Mile	0:55:54													Another lakeshore run, there's definitely some pace fuckery going on here because there's no way I've been running a 7:12 first mile then all of a sudden going 6:30 pace. It feels like I'm going pretty fast the whole time, but whatever. Legs got a little tight again around mile 6 but honestly I have no idea how fast I'm actually going, but I do feel good so it can't hurt that bad.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-13	9:59 AM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:56:02													Looking back on this run, I was definitely a little sick. Went down Warren road and between almost shitting my pants several times and just feeling blegh, it wasn't all that great. <br><br>Took Sunday off to rest up.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-15	6:49 PM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:56:54													Ran today even though still a little sick, felt pretty rough honestly. Did a hillside 3rd street loop and just got harder and harder as I got closer to the finish. Feel alright now though, hopefully tomorrow treats me better.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-16	11:18 AM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:50:18													Very rough Sare out and back. Pace was slow, heartbeat was high, and had to stop around 6 miles just to catch my breath. 				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-17	11:05 AM	Run	Easy	7.02	Mile	0:48:22													Another rough run, this time in the hood. Pace was a lot faster but heartbeat was still very high. Feeling less sick though!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-07-18	9:54 AM	Run	Easy	7.29	Mile	0:51:49													Felt pretty good today! Went on the new rail to trail addition, it was actually very nice. Gravel shoulder and shade the whole way. Slower than yesterday, but heart rate was much better.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99

2019-08-03	5:19 PM	Run	Easy	4.01	Mile	0:28:35													A PURDUE run, of all places. Did a loop on the course and hey, turns out it didn't slow me down that much.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-08-04	11:27 PM	Run	Easy	4.11	Mile	0:31:08													I mean I guess this is what I get for running at 11:30, but damn I was slow. I was really sore and tired too just from a long day and I actually felt pretty good on this so I'm happy. Kind of a throw away week anyways.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-08-05	8:01 PM	Run	Easy	5.13	Mile	0:36:34													Slightly earlier run today, obviously went much faster and still felt really good. Legs are still pretty tight.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99

2019-08-08	3:08 PM	Run	Easy	5.01	Mile	0:36:12													Hot as BALLS even on rail trail, the shade cant protect me from the evils of the sun and its heat bringing powers. Legs felt alright, got faster every mile so that's neat I guess. Dropped from 7:30 to 6:55				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99								
2019-08-09	9:06 AM	Run	Easy	5.04	Mile	0:35:38													Pretty painful rail trail run with grace, i haven't talked and ran this much in a long time. 35 hour recovery time lol. One day I'll be the man I once was.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99

2020-04-25	6:24 PM	Run	Long	8.01	Mile	0:59:24													Rainy day can't stop these legs from shining when I need them! Excellent long run on a sare-olcott-high street loop. I was a little scared because my legs felt weak right as I got to high street, but those hills ain't shit. Great way to cap off a 32 mile week! Excited to see where I can go from here.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-04-27	6:22 PM	Run	Easy	4.01	Mile	0:30:15													Nice and easy jog in the hood, feel pretty good after Saturday!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00

Felt a little tougher today, but it was about 72 outside and there were hills everywhere, but I'm aiming for a nice fartlek at north tomorrow and this is exactly what I needed to feel ready for it.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00

2020-04-29	6:55 PM	Run	Easy	0.51	Mile	0:3:57													Cooldown after the workout. Honestly today's work was pretty tame despite getting a few miles in, but I think that's for the best. Breathing got a little tough on the last 3 minute rep since it was almost entirely on an incline, kinda wish I did a third set, but the hill strides worked out.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-04-30	7:14 PM	Run	Easy	4.09	Mile	0:31:08													Cold day outside with some wind, didn't feel bad but didn't feel great. Good recovery day.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-05-01	7:07 PM	Run	Easy	5.06	Mile	0:35:27													Said fuck it, it's nice outside and I went slow yesterday so Ima speed it up and beat it up. Went up Sare and down through Olcott from KMart, the hills were rough but I held on and even closed at a 6:46! It feels like the old days but more painful. Excellent run!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-05-02	7:36 PM	Run	Long	8.30	Mile	1:00:16													Flower run in 80 degree weather after 5 miles at 7:00 pace??? Nonsense! But yet it was done by a guy like me, at a solid pace too. Definitely was in some pain the whole time because of what I did yesterday, heart rate was high and hills were tough. The temperature no doubt had a role to play in that as well. Still, an excellent long run to cap off another great week. Looking forward to raising some mileage next week!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-05-04	5:42 PM	Run	Easy	5.14	Mile	0:40:01													My oh my were the legs tired today! Despite the slow pace, I actually felt very good!

2020-05-05	6:41 PM	Run	Easy	5.06	Mile	0:37:18													Chilly and hilly, but it don't matter cuz I felt pretty good. You know what they say about going up bayles, every time you go up your self esteem goes down!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-05-06	7:55 PM	Run	Easy	0.65	Mile	0:5:24													Short cooldown after hills. This workout was excellent! On par with early workouts from last summer, which may be overkill but since I'm only doing one workout a week I think it's good to wear myself out once a week. I was definitely feeling it after the fartlek and the hills put me a whole other dimension, I'm writing this after hours and I'm still a little foggy. Legs feel pretty solid though, I'm sure they're tired but this was as much of an aerobic workout as it was anaerobic and I was breathing heavy. The third hill was definitely a killer, 20 seconds in and my legs were already jelly. Incredible workout, very proud of my progress so far!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-05-07	6:09 PM	Run	Easy	5.24	Mile	0:39:21													Perfect day outside, 64 and sunny, and I felt great after yesterday's workout! The knee soreness is officially a problem however since it was hurting the entire run, although it did loosen up around halfway through. I'll start icing, rolling, and stretching more and hopefully nip this in the bud.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-05-08	6:02 PM	Run	Easy	5.02	Mile	0:36:23													Despite waking up with a slight case of the DOMS, everything felt better today! The legs, the breathing, the knee, twas all excellent. The wind kinda sucked but it was still a nice day outside. Ran another 3rd-10th st loop and the hills didn't phase me one bit.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-05-09	7:33 PM	Run	Long	9.18	Mile	1:06:24													Pretty chill long run down the B-line and back up walnut. I wish I didn't wear my new shoes, had some foot soreness but was able to stop halfway, rub and stretch, and finish the last half feeling good! Finished very strong up cascades and kinser and felt great. Another great end to another great week.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-05-11	12:53 PM	Run	Easy	6.01	Mile	0:46:18													I was understandably tired today between a quick long run on Saturday, hiking yesterday, and running 6 today. I felt much better a few miles in though and was able to crack in the 7:30s. 6 miles doesn't feel like a recovery day, but hopefully the pace makes up for it. 40 miles this week here I come.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-05-12	11:20 PM	Run	Easy	6.04	Mile	0:45:28													Late night post girlfriend run, really didn't feel that good even though it was nice and quiet downtown. Not sure doing a a workout tomorrow would be the best idea after work given how I felt today and won't have proper recovery, we'll just see how it goes.

2020-05-16	6:07 PM	Run	Long	10.03	Mile	1:15:25													It was hot and I was dead today, but I got it done. Went to Olcott, to south, back to KMart. The hills and heat were tough. Hopefully the slower pace won't make me too tired or sore next week. But hey, first 40 mile week! 				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-05-18	4:55 PM	Run	Easy	6.02	Mile	0:45:02													Lil zville excursion on the rail trial, it was busy out and I was definitely a little tired but it was a nice change of scenery. 				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-05-23	1:47 PM	Run	Long	10.16	Mile	1:11:42													In case I was wondering how I would feel this week without a workout, the answer is incredible. Ran the first 3 miles with mike the dyke on a campus loop and pushed the pace slightly, ended up going pretty quick afterwards on a walmart loop and finished with a 6:23. Legs were tight, but pace felt great. A good way to end a week of solid mileage!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-05-25	8:24 PM	Run	Easy	6.05	Mile	0:45:11													Late night run in the hood, feeling pretty good after an excellent long run on Sunday.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-05-27	11:50 AM	Run	Easy	6.03	Mile	0:44:38													Pace seems slow, but it was a hilly run up Sare, through Olcott, and back on Smith. Felt solid up the hills.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-05-28	11:59 AM	Run	Easy	6.11	Mile	0:45:29													Again, not a great job escaping the heat, but ran this gravel hill route was faster than the one two weeks ago! Hill wasnt great, but I did it.<br>				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-05-29	11:35 AM	Run	Easy	6.05	Mile	0:42:49													Wasn't too hot today, but was not able to outrun the rain. Felt very solid on a third street to walnut to 10th street loop even with the hills!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-05-30	11:32 AM	Run	Long	10.08	Mile	1:10:56													Simple pooplant out and back, another long run where I felt great! Chugged up the hills at 6:44 and the last mile was 6:28. Funny enough felt smoother than last week despite more elevation, but it was pretty nice out at 68 and sunny. Honestly feeling very confident after some solid runs the past two weeks, even without workouts. <br><br>I think my goal for June is to keep mileage around 40-45 and quicken the pace of easy runs while keeping 2-3 days available for total recovery at whatever pace feels good. By July if I can do a weekly workout like I want to then I'll be happy.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

It was only about 3.5 miles long so I finished with some loops at the beginning, and oh my was I feeling fast. After hovering around 7 minute pace for most of the run, the last two miles were 6:24 and 6:13 in the 90 degree weather. Definitely tired after, but this was my best long run yet!

2020-06-20	9:28 AM	Run	Long	11.10	Mile	1:19:02													HOT long run on a bypass-hillside loop. I was feeling solid on the bypass downhill, but man once I hit hillside I was feeling it. Didn't end on a fast note like the last few long runs but with the heat and elevation gain I'm alright with that, and hey, I still got 11 miles. <br><br>Overall this was an excellent week of 45 miles, fastest average pace yet and feeling strong still. Seems like all those weeks at 40 paid off! I'll take it day by day next week to see if I want to hold at 45, hit 50, or something in between. If next week stays cool I can see 50 being pretty reasonable.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-06-22	11:27 AM	Run	Easy	7.13	Mile	0:53:28													Nice out and back on Sare road, found a short trail behind one of the neighborhoods and decided to follow it, ended up being pretty cool!

Andy and Isaac were going a little quicker than me and definitely set a fast tone for the workout, but I kept with them alright! Fell behind on reps 2-5, busted slightly on the last one to stay with them but honestly wasn't too worn out, legs were just a little shocked by running this quick. All in all fun little workout.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00

2020-07-02	9:15 AM	Run	Easy	2.19	Mile	0:16:59													Cooldown after Cascades. All in all great workout, shot for 5 hills but felt good enough to go for 6 and made it! Managed to keep an even pace on all of them too. Very tired after though.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-07-03	7:40 AM	Run	Easy	7.17	Mile	0:49:50													IU course with le bois, definitely a little bit tired from the hills yesterday but not excessively so. Felt good enough to run 7 minute pace!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-07-04	10:21 AM	Run	Long	12.04	Mile	1:27:27													Pretty tough long run on the B-line, thank god for no hills and mostly shade or else this would have sucked even worse. Felt dead by mile 8 but was able to push through and hold a decent pace. Sucky way to end the week, but not my worst long run or anything. Im proud that I finished!

2020-07-06	7:52 AM	Run	Easy	7.91	Mile	1:01:19													Some easy running at McCormick's Creek, went on a few trails that slowed the pace down but it was solid effort with some elevation.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-07-07	8:09 AM	Run	Easy	2.81	Mile	0:20:40													Cooldown after the excellent tempo! Felt incredibly solid through the first 2 miles, the second reckoning of Prow is never fun but stayed in there with Isaac and Isaiah. The last half mile felt like race intensity but didn't feel too tired afterwards so very good effort without overdoing it.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-07-08	9:18 AM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:53:54													Sloooow run in the hood, only 9 am but already hot as hell. Felt fine though				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-07-11	9:25 AM	Run	Long	12.17	Mile	1:24:21													Went down lakeside for even longer this time and felt great! Dropped a 6:17 last mile, wasn't sure I was up for it since around 8 miles again my legs felt a little strained and it was heating up just like last week, but I pulled it off probably no doubt with the help of a bunch of slow running this week!<br><br>Speaking of, this is my slowest week in awhile, but I think it was a good way to absorb the mileage and workouts I've been doing lately without decreasing mileage. This is the best my legs have felt in weeks so I'm excited to keep up some workouts and long runs in the coming month!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-07-13	7:44 AM	Run	Easy	9.01	Mile	1:03:10													Chilly Morgan Monroe state forest bike trail run with the boys! Felt great today, shooting for 55 this week.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00

2020-07-15	7:05 AM	Run	Easy	8.03	Mile	0:55:04													Quick rail trail run from switchyard park. Legs are feeling a little sore from yesterday's strides, hills, and work, but I'll be more than ready for hill repeats tomorrow.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-07-16	8:30 AM	Run	Easy	3.24	Mile	0:26:05													Easy mileage at Cascades and back up Cascades to north. GREAT workout! I felt incredible the entire time with a 59.6 on the last one, unfortunately I was beat out by a big crowd of man dudes + paul and henry but I was middle of the pack for every other rep so I don't mind. This is my new cascade repeats PR and I couldn't be more stoked. Excellent day.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-07-17	7:07 AM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:56:59													Another Friday IUXC course day, felt a little tired on the hills but otherwise pretty solid.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-07-18	6:10 AM	Run	Long	13.10	Mile	1:29:20													BEAUTIFUL zionsville long run, first half marathon in over a year! Legs felt sluggish the first half of the run, but as soon as I turned around at 421 I picked up the pace and felt great. 6:29/6:21/5:56 last three miles and the only issue I had was feeling like I had to shit my pants but managed to hold it in and finish quick. Amazing way to end the week with my best long run of the summer, couldn’t be happier.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

Solid workout, was unable to keep up with the guys on the second tempo but managed to stay consistent on the hills! Definitely was still tired from yesterday and last week, gonna take a me day tomorrow to rest up for hills on Thursday.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-07-22	7:58 AM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:58:03													Made today a me day and ran solo, felt pretty good after a tough day yesterday and a hilly Olcott loop today. Unfortunately the rain dumped on me but it felt kinda nice.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-07-23	8:00 AM	Run	Easy	2.45	Mile	0:19:11													Slooow cooldown at cascades. This week was just a tad slower than last week, but I figured it would with a quick 55 mile week last week, a tempo on Tuesday, and one more repeat this week. But I'm still proud of today, plus the next two days are as easy as I want and a down week next week! 				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-07-24	7:06 AM	Run	Easy	9.28	Mile	1:06:10													Another IU Friday with le bois, felt stiff the first few miles but felt great the last few miles. Solid recovery after yesterday!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-07-25	6:38 AM	Run	Long	13.10	Mile	1:28:49													ASTOUNDING long run today! Started at switchyard, ran to Karst, and then got on the other end of the B-line to finish up. Despite a few miles on west third street, I didn't have to stop once besides for some annoying sidewalk construction but I stopped for only a few seconds. I also felt incredible and ran the last 3 miles in 6:30/6:23/5:47 and felt strong and composed at the end. Beats last weeks curry stomach.<br><br>Overall this was the best week of training I've had all year hands down. I was afraid I'd be feeling fatigued from last week, 2 tough workouts, and today's long run, but I feel as good as ever. With that being said I'm excited for a down week next week and for the race on Friday. Time to see if all this running actually pays off.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-07-27	7:05 AM	Run	Easy	5.96	Mile	0:40:50													DOWN WEEK BABY! Felt super solid on a quicker rail trail run with grace. If I feel like this all week im breaking 16 on Friday.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-07-28	7:30 AM	Run	Easy	3.90	Mile	0:29:16													Recovery 200's and cooldown mileage. Didn't feel amazing today, heart rate was a little high but legs felt fine. Chest has been feeling a little tight since the run yesterday, not sure what it is but I'll just try to take it easy the next two days and hopefully feel 110% for the race. Still a solid tune up workout!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-07-29	7:06 AM	Run	Easy	7.20	Mile	0:51:38													Nice and cool IUXC run with the boys, felt loads better than yesterday.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-07-30	7:34 AM	Run	Easy	5.93	Mile	0:42:17													Some downtown running with grace, felt a little like I did on Tuesday but honestly I think it has just been the humidity and warm mornings that get the heartrate up. Legs feel great and I'm excited for tomorrow!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-07-31	7:59 AM	Run	Easy	3.24	Mile	0:24:41													Cooldown on a Arlington school loop. Despite hitting my exact PR from midsummer sophomore year, I feel great about this race! Kind of a weird race when there were only 4 other people, but I had Isaiah to keep me honest as I was with him the whole time.<br><br>As for criticisms, I was not mentally in this one. I was constantly checking my watch to make sure I was going under 17, and I don't think I cared how much under I was. I didn't race Isaiah on the track at the end and I definitely could have squeaked out a few more seconds on that last K if I solely focused on form. I think having not raced much the past few years, and not having done any tough workouts for over a year, I'm just lacking the confidence and focus that I used to have in high school. I think if I really grind out some tough workouts during this fall I'll have the confidence, and hopefully the focus, that I need to really feel good about the times I hit.<br><br>With that being said, the fact I can hit the same time I did senior year with much less training in terms of mileage and workouts, I think that bodes well for my potential this season. I'm not feeling any fatigue like I was my senior year and I have months to add some actual anaerobic work this season. I might have built the most stable base I've ever had, and I'm excited to see what I can do next. 				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-08-01	8:50 AM	Run	Long	11.02	Mile	1:18:58													Sluggish Cumberland loop, but cool weather outside! Definitely sore from the 5k and not great sleep the past few days, but its a down week so its alright. Speaking of, not sure how recovered I feel after this week but hopefully I feel it more next week.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-08-03	7:35 AM	Run	Easy	9.02	Mile	1:04:01													Beautiful brown county state park run, legs felt rough on the first 3 miles which was almost entirely uphill, but cruised on the way back and felt much better than on Saturday. Not sure what mileage I want to hit this week, everyone I'm running with is doing 65-75 so maybe I'll just do 9 everyday.

2020-08-04	8:45 AM	Run	Easy	1.08	Mile	0:8:39													Cooldown. Overall nice and chill fartlek, I actually felt really good today but held back a bit since I was helping pace Grace, but that's honestly a good thing with 9 x Cascades on Thursday and a 55 mile week.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-08-05	7:08 AM	Run	Easy	9.01	Mile	1:03:41													Beautiful foggy Griffy loop, hills were a little killer and legs a bit sore but it's just a good warmup for Cascades tomorrow.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2020-08-06	8:15 AM	Run	Easy	1.60	Mile	0:13:44													Cooldown. Could only manage 8/9 while also going slower than usual, but this was still a good workout. Legs are just tired from the hills on Monday and Wednesday, and 8 Cascades is never bad. I was able to stay strong and finish around average on the last two and I'm proud. Solid day!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-08-07	7:08 AM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:57:33													Sore rail trail with da boys.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-08-08	6:53 AM	Run	Long	13.30	Mile	1:27:30													I'm running out of adjectives for all of these incredible long rungs! MARVELOUS loop starting at K-mart, to the B-Line, back on the bypass, all while wearing an IU singlet. Started out quick and stayed that way, 6:19/6:18/5:46 last 3 miles going up the bypass no less, definitely felt some strain but felt very strong as well. Best long run of the summer no doubt!<br><br>The week went pretty well too, no crazy workouts or anything but this is only my third week of 55 and I don't feel quite as tired as I did the first two weeks, likely thanks to a down week last week. As long as I feel this good I'll hold 55 for awhile and see what kind of workouts I can start busting out. Time to shine baby.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-10	7:14 AM	Run	Easy	9.01	Mile	1:01:53													Quick and hilly loop around Isaac's house, but you can't stop this train even on a Monday. But my legs do hurt though :( hopefully they feel good for some work this week.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-08-11	8:30 AM	Run	Easy	1.51	Mile	0:11:42													Cooldown. This was quite the interesting workout, by far my longest one of the summer. Ran it with one of the fast IU girls and we ran together for all of it besides the 30 second reps towards the end. Felt very strong the whole way through and probably could have pushed harder on the first 10 minutes, as well as ran all the way through the rests, but overall still a solid workout to get me back into the groove of longer stuff. Kerr Creek is also a nice road!				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-08-12	8:12 AM	Run	Easy	9.05	Mile	1:06:30													Chill flower run with Miles and Henry, legs are sooooore from yesterday so this change of pace was excellent timing.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-13	7:22 AM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:57:38													Lil morgan monroe run with grace with 6 x 30 second hill strides after, nothing too intense so I'll just count it as one run.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-14	7:19 AM	Run	Easy	2.90	Mile	0:20:46													Warmup and cooldown for the tempo, which was EXCELLENT! The hills got to me on the second go around of Acuff, but I had Grace and her music to keep me going. Legs just felt great in general today too, which is surprisingly because I've really been pushing my body the past 2 weeks. Shakeout later today and a long run tomorrow, all of which I will likely take pretty easy just so this unexpected 60 mile week doesn't bite me in the ass next week.

2020-08-15	6:31 AM	Run	Long	14.02	Mile	1:38:05													First 14 mile run since JUNE 30th! Very chilled out compared to last week's run, but that was expected given the mileage and workouts I've had this week. I ran 5 miles down Bayles and up Cascades, then met up with the Man Dudes for a flower run loop to finish it out. Felt rough after 10-11 miles but finished strong up Cascades the second time and Kinser. Great way to end the week without murdering my legs, and a good way to say goodbye to the boys. Let's keep this same energy for next week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-17	6:43 AM	Run	Easy	11.92	Mile	1:26:06													Wild ride on the McGowen-Kent loop out towards Brown County with Isaiah and Nathaniel. The Devil's Backbone does exist, and it is an absolute pain to run up, but I managed not to walk any of it! Very fun run and overall not that tiring, feeling pretty good for 12 miles.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-08-18	7:30 AM	Run	Easy	9.05	Mile	1:04:49													Last run in Monroe County for awhile on an Ellettsville out and back with Nathaniel and Isaiah.

2020-08-19	4:30 PM	Run	Easy	2.53	Mile	0:19:50													Cooldown. Very solid workout, went about as well as I could have expected in my first afternoon run of the hot summer! Was planning for 5, but given how this is my first day in the heat, I wanted to feel like I could have done one more at the end than over exert myself this early on in the season. And given how hilly the mile loop is, I'd say the times were excellent! Awesome first interval workout.				adidas	Boston 7	9.00	US/Canada		90.00								
2020-08-20	3:33 PM	Run	Easy	9.00	Mile	1:01:23													Day two of running in the heat, this time with Nathaniel on a long happy hollow to heritage trail loop. Went pretty quick but still felt alright.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-21	4:02 PM	Run	Easy	9.00	Mile	1:03:54													Ran all the way out on the bike path past Walmart, really pretty and fairly shaded! Kind of a bitch though with all of the traffic stops but I didn't mind, I wanted today to be an easy day and it was. Legs feel solid and breathing was on point.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-22	2:27 PM	Run	Long	14.00	Mile	1:38:59													Right river - soldiers home loop with the Dixon, it was hot as fuck and my legs were trashed by mile 10, feel alright the next day though. Overall solid week of 60, heat training hasn't been too tough and I even managed to fit in a great workout on Wednesday! 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-24	2:36 PM	Run	Easy	9.07	Mile	1:05:19													Now this was a hot one, 90 degrees on the XC course. Honestly not as terrible as I thought it would be. Heart rate was 10 bpm higher than I would expect going 7:13 pace, but felt great!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-08-25	8:15 AM	Run	Easy	1.50	Mile	0:10:49													Warmup<br>				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-25	9:00 AM	Run	Fartlek	3.27	Mile	0:20:00													10' on, 2' off, 8' on all on the bike trail<br><br>1.69 (5:55), 1.31 (6:06)<br><br>3 miles at 6:00 pace				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-25	9:30 AM	Run	Easy	2.98	Mile	0:22:45													Cooldown. Felt very rough on this workout, tried to go with a tempo but realized quickly I wasn't going to hit pace. Then I tried to go for 10', 8', 6', 4', 2' but after the 8' I was completely spent and jogged it in. Felt pretty bad the rest of the day afterwards.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-26	4:55 PM	Run	Easy	8.11	Mile	1:02:52													Slowest run in awhile on left river, hoping to find some shade while it's hot as balls out. Felt alright to be honest, last mile was rough in the sun and up the hill by the power plant but the rest of the run was chill.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-08-27	3:57 PM	Run	Easy	5.62	Mile	0:43:30													Today was simply a no go. Felt good the first two miles, then I started to slow down to keep the heartrate down but I hit 8:00 for my fifth mile and I knew it was going downhill. Walked/putted the rest of the way home, which was just as painful. I'm not sure what exactly caused my legs to feel this shitty, but it's clearly time to take a few days off. I'll reevaluate on Monday and see what to do from there.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-01	4:27 PM	Run	Easy	5.17	Mile	0:37:09													First run after a few days off, felt MUCH better than last week but definitely still a little something left over in the legs today. Felt pretty smooth in the middle and a little tired the last mile or so, but I probably went too quick. Planning on just going easy the rest of the week.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-09-02	5:17 PM	Run	Easy	6.03	Mile	0:42:42													Right river out and back, legs were a little flustered after some sexy time but I'm still feeling good.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-03	5:10 PM	Run	Easy	5.83	Mile	0:41:23													Hot, hilly, and windy run on the XC course. Legs were feeling fine but I was breathing pretty hard, I should probably chill out tomorrow.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-09-04	4:51 PM	Run	Easy	6.03	Mile	0:42:30													Felt like my old self today on a Happy Hollow loop, legs were sore but I was still cruisin.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-05	5:21 PM	Run	Long	9.01	Mile	1:05:42													A pretty dope run on the southside of the wabash heritage trail toward Ouiatenon Fort, only made it probably halfway down the trail before I had to head back but I look forward to going the whole way on my next 12 mile run! All in all good week, definitely a little more tired than I would like to be but I think I'll just stick to 45-50 miles tops the rest of this "season". Maybe not do as much interval work as I was planning and just focus on hills and tempos, I like those the most anyways. Maybe catch a few segments as well.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-09-07	4:24 PM	Run	Easy	6.06	Mile	0:42:26													Out and back on a cool new bike path going out towards aesthetic route. The construction kinda blows but I could see it being a cool route in the future once its all done. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-08	3:04 PM	Run	Easy	7.12	Mile	0:51:26													Went to the BOG today for the first time in a long time. Felt like I was working pretty hard today, heat index of 93. The nature calmed me down though, so much so I'm gonna build a cabin and tend to my gardens.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-09	3:28 PM	Run	Easy	7.02	Mile	0:50:22													It was another hot one today, and my legs weren't a huge fan. Tried to find a new way to get onto the bike path across sagamore and it was fairly successful, but there is a lot of stopping at busy roads which kinda sucks. Still a pretty decent run though, I should actually make myself go slow tomorrow.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-10	3:21 PM	Run	Easy	7.02	Mile	0:57:56													Fun excursion into the McCormick woods, trails are definitely rugged but it was a nice changeup. Legs are still very sore for some reason				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-09-11	5:49 PM	Run	Easy	4.83	Mile	0:35:44													Rough day on the XC course, legs were stiff and running was tough so I cut it short 2 miles. Maybe lots of spikeball before kinda killed me				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-09-12	3:35 PM	Run	Long	10.00	Mile	1:11:56													Felt MUCH better today than yesterday, although my legs still felt a little stale but I was able to pick it up towards the end and finish with a 6:44 at the end of a left river out and back. Very peaceful and relaxing run.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-14	4:00 PM	Run	Easy	7.17	Mile	0:52:38													Excellent start to the week with an easy run on the XC course. Legs were a little sore so I'll try to get back into stretching.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-15	3:59 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:49:11													Fun happy hollow loop. I couldn't tell if I felt good because my breathing was calm and steady but my legs felt pretty sore. Either way still a nice run with a pretty good finish up the Ahler hills.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-16	2:59 PM	Run	Easy	6.81	Mile	0:52:01													Another bog excursion, this time I parked by the agriculture fields and ran 3 whole loops! Legs were definitely sore from yesterday but I took it nice and easy.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-09-17	3:57 PM	Run	Easy	1.91	Mile	0:13:58													Warmup to hilltop				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-17	4:00 PM	Run	Hill	1.61	Mile	0:12:08													6 x Ross Ade Drive hill from stop sign to emergency button, rest on other half of loop<br><br>44/43/43/44/43/43				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-17	4:15 PM	Run	Easy	2.63	Mile	0:20:17													Cooldown back home immediately after. This was actually a fun little loop that worked out well. It might not be as long or consistent of a hill as Tower Drive, but the sidewalks and roads are definitely less busy. I was honestly nervous for this workout given how I've been feeling the past few weeks, but my legs felt strong. I felt a little out of breath but relaxed afterwards. Looking to do 8-10 next week, and then maybe move on to a bigger hill!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-18	3:56 PM	Run	Easy	7.02	Mile	0:50:45													Felt really strong today on the county section of the wabash heritage trail! Legs still slightly stale, but no permanent damage was done on the hills yesterday which is an excellent sign. Excited for what is hopefully a good long run tomorrow.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-19	2:49 PM	Run	Long	11.00	Mile	1:13:41													Must have been the 65 degree weather because this run came out of left field! Dropped a 7:05 first mile and that's when I knew I wanted to bust some ass, but I held it in until the last 5 miles because I didn't want to overdo it. Went 6:46/6:39/6:26/6:13/5:51 on the last 5, really felt it in the last half mile but that might have just been my stomach getting angry at me for just eating a few hours beforehand.<br><br>Definitely tired as hell after and I'll probably be feeling this one the next few days, but I really needed this. The past few weeks have been rough after what was such an incredible summer. I'm very happy to see I'm back to a place where I can have a run like this. Hopefully in the next few weeks I feel back to normal and can do some cool workouts, maybe run a few time trials in late october/early november and see how hard I can push myself before taking a break for finals week. I'm just happy I've stuck with training through this weird drought.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-21	3:20 PM	Run	Easy	8.17	Mile	1:00:19													Another beautiful easy day on the XC course, legs felt a little sore at the end but they feel fine now. It was weird going 8 miles again but I think as long as I take my time on easy days I'll be great. And no more stale legs, at least for today!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-22	4:21 PM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	0:55:45													Good day on left river. Was feeling pretty solid the first half so I came back faster on the second, last three miles were 6:46/6:44/6:23 up the harrison hill. Nothing special, but I'm glad I came back from my long run!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-23	3:37 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:53:59													Little easy stroll down at the Bog. Legs definitely feel trashed but the heartrate was low!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-09-24	3:40 PM	Run	Easy	3.38	Mile	0:24:17													Warmup down to Happy Hollow				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2020-09-24	4:15 PM	Run	Easy	2.35	Mile	0:17:30													Cooldown back to the house. This hill wasn't as steep as I thought it would be, about a 7-8% grade with 60 feet gained every rep. It was however entirely shaded and much easier to keep my form composed than Cascades which I enjoyed. I'm definitely excited to get a few more reps in each week and maybe even extend the time interval. Also perhaps do entire hill repeats towards the end of the semester just for fun? We shall see.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-25	4:21 PM	Run	Easy	7.21	Mile	0:54:53													Went on the battleground wabash heritage trail, and it was pretty funny to run on. Definitely not meant for running towards the trail end but the southside of the Burnett bridge is pretty chill. Looking forward to doing a long run on the entire trail soon!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-28	5:35 PM	Run	Easy	8.11	Mile	1:00:17													Another XC course monday, this time I ran a mile with michael howell! Legs feel a little off despite not running over the weekend. Granted, the hard party on Friday probably didn't rest me all that much.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-29	4:27 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:50:07													No tempo today, but I felt pretty good on the Ouiatenon section of the WHT!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-09-30	3:57 PM	Run	Easy	8.12	Mile	0:56:01													Interesting Bike Trail to Salisbury loop, mileage worked out pretty well! It was windy as fuck though, but that didn't stop my from going a little quick today. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-01	3:46 PM	Run	Easy	3.36	Mile	0:24:23													Taking it easy on the warmup.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-01	4:30 PM	Run	Hill	2.26	Mile	0:15:52													7 x 60" up Happy Hollow Hill<br><br>0.16(6:24), 0.17(5:55), 0.17(5:57), 0.17(6:00), 0.17 (5:57), 0.16 (6:17), 0.17 (5:54)				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-01	4:45 PM	Run	Easy	2.41	Mile	0:18:14													Cooldown. Didn't feel as hot as I did last week, I think yesterday's slight speed got to me a little today. Still a very good workout! Happy Hollow isn't as hard as Cascades, but 7 reps of 60" is still impressive and I'm proud. Here's to one or two more next week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-02	3:58 PM	Run	Easy	7.03	Mile	0:52:07													Easy stroll on left river. Legs were definitely a little tired, but I tried my best to keep heart rate low.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-03	2:42 PM	Run	Long	12.07	Mile	1:23:11													Very smooth long run on a highway-happy hollow road loop. Didn't close fast like the last long run, but legs still felt pretty solid.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-05	3:39 PM	Run	Easy	8.06	Mile	0:58:49													Another Monday, another easy day on the XC course. Felt really good today!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99

2020-10-06	4:45 PM	Run	Fartlek	4.40	Mile	0:26:00													4 x 5' on, 2' off on left river paved trail<br><br>0.89(5:37), 0.90(5:34), 0.91(5:30), 0.91(5:31)				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-06	5:15 PM	Run	Easy	1.84	Mile	0:14:19													Cooldown. Honestly very impressed with this workout! I knew I was feeling good on the warmup and just went straight into the ons. The last one hurt no doubt, but I managed to close as fast as the previous rep. I definitely like left river as a workout route as well, no stops and few people on the trail.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-07	2:53 PM	Run	Easy	7.04	Mile	0:51:43													Nice recovery Walmart loop. Legs are definitely very sore.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2020-10-08	4:00 PM	Run	Hill	1.56	Mile	0:11:02													5 x 60" up Happy Hollow Hill<br><br>0.16(6:23), 0.16(6:20), 0.17(5:56), 0.17(5:57), 0.17(5:59)				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-08	4:15 PM	Run	Easy	2.12	Mile	0:15:32													Cooldown after hills. Honestly wasn't feeling great beforehand, so I told myself I'd go a little easy today since I was still tired from Tuesday. I still felt pretty good on all of the reps and felt good on the cool down, so I'm glad I took it a little easier! I'd rather feel like I could have done a few more than over do it as I get back into workout shape.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-09	3:36 PM	Run	Easy	8.02	Mile	1:00:22													Very rough run on the south side of right river, chest felt tight and legs felt tighter. Almost walked it in after going up Ahler but I managed to make it back home. It was a little hot and windy, so the workouts of the week probably just felt worse.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-10	3:12 PM	Run	Long	12.02	Mile	1:24:57													360 turn around from how I felt yesterday, this was actually the most relaxed long run I've had in a long time! Ran up to Kalberer and back down soldier's road, stayed extremely consistent the entire run. Legs got tight around mile 9, but that's to be expected. <br><br>Overall I'd say this was a solid training week. The workouts definitely fucked me up pretty hard, which is reflected in the pace of my easy runs. Hopefully my body can adapt quickly and I can run a few more workouts before having a 5k time trial. I'd really like to get a tempo and interval in.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-12	3:25 PM	Run	Easy	8.07	Mile	0:59:14													Not the most relaxing run I've had on the course, the wind and rain made for a deadly cold and tough combo to run through for a few miles but managed to stay calm and have a good run.				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v2	99.99								
2020-10-13	2:40 PM	Run	Easy	2.32	Mile	0:16:36													Warmup				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2020-10-13	3:20 PM	Run	Easy	2.90	Mile	0:20:15													Cooldown after the tempo. This is one of those workouts that make me question what kind of shape I'm really in, because god damn I felt incredible today! I easily could have gone for another mile, or some fartlek work afterwards, but given how shitty I felt last week I wanted to keep it short and simple. Awesome tempo. good weather, cooldown faster than the warmup, I'm feeling myself baby.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-14	5:28 PM	Run	Easy	6.83	Mile	0:49:00													Ran a new lil loop going on the highway bike trail to salisbury. It was windy and my legs were definitely sore from yesterday, but still felt pretty good! Much better than last Wednesday.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2020-10-15	4:00 PM	Run	Easy	2.81	Mile	0:21:00													Cooldown. Pumped about how well this workout went, I really focused on form and staying consistent throughout the whole rep instead of checking my watch 2-3 times. Managed to hit under 6 minute pace for each rep, which is a solid improvement, and I finished with a hard kick on the 6th rep. Solid!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-16	3:57 PM	Run	Easy	5.81	Mile	0:42:35													Easy trail run starting from Ouiatenon Park to scout out for a whole ass trail run tomorrow! Trail was nice pretty clear and well maintained, legs felt pretty good too. Beautiful day out.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-17	3:24 PM	Run	Long	13.10	Mile	1:26:59													Finally did it and ran the ENTIRE WABASH HERITAGE TRAIL! This run was a ton of fun, and a very solid workout as well. I'm very proud of myself for maintaining this pace given how rough the terrain is in some parts of the trail, definitely did not expect to run 6:30 pace for the later half of the run and to close with a 6:14/5:43 last two miles but I felt incredible!<br><br>Overall this was an awesome week, such a turnaround from last week where I was struggling on most of my easy runs to now have probably one of the best long runs/half marathons in years. If this was on the roads I easily would have PR'd and probably could have gone under 6:30 pace, but I can always save it for another day. Great workouts this week and I'm looking forward to the workout next week, with a 5k time trial after. Looking like I'll have a good end to the season after the weirdness that was September!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-19	4:57 PM	Run	Easy	8.08	Mile	0:58:42													Second cloudy and dark monday XC course run in a row, and it was even a little chillier this time. Legs felt great today though, I'm surprised I recovered as quickly as I did from my long run on Saturday. Feeling excited for this week's workout!

2020-10-20	3:43 PM	Run	Easy	7.03	Mile	0:49:12													Solid happy hollow loop, went a little quick on the last mile with a 6:37 but I was just feeling good and wanted to stretch the legs before tomorrow's workout.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2020-10-21	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	2.15	Mile	0:16:26													Cooldown. Solid first interval workout since August 19th! The first two miles were excellent, unfortunately the last one really got to me and only made it 3/4 of the way. I was also planning for 8 200's, but after 6 x 34-35's I was gassed. So overall, I was overally ambitious, but considering I ran 3.5/4 planned interval miles faster than planning, I'm pretty happy with myself.

2020-10-22	4:29 PM	Run	Easy	8.11	Mile	0:59:30													Wonderful 80 degree day on left river, I thought it'd be too warm up but it felt like 70! Sun was out and legs felt sore yet relaxed. Peaceful recovery run.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-23	3:14 PM	Run	Easy	7.60	Mile	0:54:22													Chilly windy day in west la la, legs at least felt pretty good while my arms were frozen. Pretty brutal headwind going northbound on the 231 bike trail, and not too much better coming back through the bog, but I got the job done.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-24	4:30 PM	Run	Long	12.04	Mile	1:22:17													I really cannot acclimate to the cold, because it was 52 degrees and I was freezing in a light long sleeve. Still a nice long run though on a Morgan Monroe bike trail out and back!  Thought about a loop but I got lost and just turned around. Picked it up towards the end and hit 6:32/6:28/6:00, which is pretty damn good on the rolling hills. Another solid week in the books.

2020-10-26	4:37 PM	Run	Easy	8.07	Mile	0:59:24													I don't know what the hell it is, but the past 3 or 4 mondays have blown major dick in terms of weather and wetness. The course surprisingly manages to never be muddy, but I'm still tired of the wind and the cold. Felt pretty good today though!				Nike	Air Zoom Pegasus 35	9.00	US/Canada	v1	99.99

2020-10-27	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	2.43	Mile	0:17:29													Cooldown back to the house. Felt ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE today, even with the somewhat lame 45 degree and rainy weather. Barely felt anything until the last mile while heading into the wind. Tapering starts now for the 5k in a few weeks! 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-28	4:20 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:50:12													Very relaxed recovery run! Quads were definitely sore, but heart rate was extremely low. The weather was nice, first day in a while where I didn't really notice the wind on a highway-Salisbury loop. Thanks West Lafayette weather.

2020-10-29	5:15 PM	Run	Easy	3.20	Mile	0:23:03													Cooldown. Didn't really feel like doing hills, so I did some 400's instead to see what kinda speed I'm working with right now. Averaged ~76 for the 400's, which is quicker than I was expecting so I called it at 8 reps. This was a great substitute for hills though, this gives me an idea of what to hit for K's next week and a good way to get used to speed! Legs felt pretty solid today but definitely a little sore now.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-30	3:51 PM	Run	Easy	7.07	Mile	0:51:25													I don't know what I'm gonna do when it actually gets cold out, because even on a 46 degree and sunny day kills my motivation to run. With that being said, I felt great today! No soreness from yesterday whatsoever, but still took it easy because I wanted to. Heartrate was insanely low, but I believe it since I barely even felt like I ran.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-10-31	3:55 PM	Run	Long	12.07	Mile	1:23:40													BEAUTIFUL day on the "Twyck Greenway" in Lafayette, which I'm convinced is just an untitled rail trail. Besides the wind going out, the ninth street hill, and the car that probably blew up, this was an awesome run, relaxed with good weather. Definitely read for a taper week next week.

2020-11-03	3:02 PM	Run	Easy	7.04	Mile	0:49:45													First day with the second pair of reeboks, tiny bit of pain in the first half mile but it was nothing a simple retie couldn't fix. 67 degrees and sunny in NOVEMBER, made for a very happy run. Pace was incredibly smooth but the legs do feel a little sore, perhaps they are beginning to recover on this wonderful down week which is a good sign.

2020-11-04	5:30 PM	Run	Easy	1.91	Mile	0:15:13													Cooldown. This workout was EXCELLENT!!! Hands down, WITHOUT A DOUBT, my best workout of 2020! I feel incredible right now, the first interval workout where I hit all of the planned distances and hit better than expected times. No question I am in great shape right now, I'm excited for the 5k next week. No matter what time I get, I've set myself up to do my absolute best. Now it's time to rest until then, I've earned it baby.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-11-05	2:47 PM	Run	Easy	6.01	Mile	0:44:51													Eaaasy day today on a happy hollow loop. Legs felt about as sore as I would have expected, but I think the pace was just about right. Still got 7 more days to feel good and ready for an all out 5k, very excited!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-11-06	12:05 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:49:47													Felt really solid on a noon left river run! Already feeling very recovered from the workout on wednesday, which is great!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-11-07	3:31 PM	Run	Long	10.00	Mile	1:09:13													Chest and legs felt a little heavy today, probably just a little sore still from the workout wednesday. Still managed to feel decent on a bike lane run, felt a little chilly without a shirt even at 70 degrees. Honestly excited for it to get back to the 50's, legs felt much better last week.

2020-11-09	4:14 PM	Run	Easy	3.01	Mile	0:21:50													Cooldown. Legs were definitely a little confused about why I was running quick on a Monday. Felt a little off, didn't help there were a ton of kids on the track since I showed up a bit early which caused me to run in different lanes for the first few reps. Doesn't matter though, all I wanted to accomplish was get up to speed a couple times and loosen up and I think I did that. Felt pretty solid on the cooldown. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-11-10	4:42 PM	Run	Easy	6.16	Mile	0:45:20													Legs still not feeling as perky as I would have hoped after a nice down week last week, even on an easy day at the course. It was pretty windy though. I just tried to take it easy, hopefully I feel better tomorrow!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-11-11	4:11 PM	Run	Easy	4.65	Mile	0:33:32													Felt MUCH better today, I'm going to guess the literal 30 degree drop in weather from yesterday helped a little bit. Decked out in full winter weather gear for the first time just to make sure I stayed warm on a nice and easy run. Ran 6 strides on the track after with spikes, felt fast even in leggings. Very ready and VERY excited for tomorrow!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2020-11-23	3:36 PM	Run	Easy	5.02	Mile	0:35:56													Had a very relaxing 10 day break and felt good today! I've got some weird bloating and gas issues at the moment, but everything else felt great, including my knee which has had a nagging pain in its side for months. Feeling refreshed and ready to train again! Sub 16 5k here we come again.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-11-24	3:43 PM	Run	Easy	5.03	Mile	0:36:08													Last run at the due, went for a quirky 5 mile 231-grand prix track loop. Felt a little sore, but felt pretty good.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-11-27	3:43 PM	Run	Easy	5.01	Mile	0:35:14													Unfortunately did not run the past few days just because I was busy, so this week is now a soft start into winter training. Legs weren't sore and my left foot front tendon didn't bother me at all so maybe the two days off were worth it! Peaceful and relaxing hood run.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-11-28	12:28 PM	Run	Easy	5.05	Mile	0:35:17													What I lacked in distance this week, I made up for with some speed. Another hood run, this one was a little colder but the sun was out and made it seem pretty nice. Looking foward to my first full week back next week!

2020-11-30	8:05 AM	Run	Easy	5.01	Mile	0:36:21													First run back with the boys at 8 am while snowing! Felt pretty solid, the cold sucked but I guess it's time to get used to it.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-01	3:09 AM	Run	Easy	6.02	Mile	0:43:03													Classy run on the rail trail with Grace, felt pretty solid and cold.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-02	8:10 AM	Run	Easy	5.92	Mile	0:48:41													FIRST PATE LOOP IN THE BOOKS! Don't let the pace deceive you, this run was fast and unforgiving. The last few hilly sections decimated any strength I had in my legs and it was tough to keep from tripping. It was a fun run though, I'm excited to head back here over the summer in better shape and better conditions to see how fast I can go.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00								
2020-12-03	3:34 PM	Run	Easy	6.03	Mile	0:43:49													Sore and slightly chilly hood run. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-04	3:52 PM	Run	Easy	7.15	Mile	0:51:20													Perhaps went just a tad too quick and/or long on a Sare out and back as my right groin started to get sore towards the end, but it was a fun run! Feels good to be back up to 7 mile runs again.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-05	3:44 PM	Run	Long	10.03	Mile	1:09:23													A beautiful run on Tower Ridge Road, I love the gravel! It also had very gradual elevation changes, except for a few notable hills, that were very enjoyable. Went a little hard the last 3 miles, 6:41/6:42/6:09, and was pretty tired after but I couldn't help myself. Definitely coming back here in a few weeks to explore some other sections.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-07	8:10 AM	Run	Easy	7.02	Mile	0:49:37													Some neighborhood running with Andy and Isaiah, felt pretty good! Knee was pretty sore yesterday but rolling and ibuprofen made for no pain today, which is sweet! Trying to run in the morning everyday this week and hit 45 miles, lets see how this goes.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-08	8:09 AM	Run	Easy	7.04	Mile	0:49:22													Nice and quick B-line run with Isaiah and Andy, did 6 x 30'ish strides afterwards. Strides made me a little tired but otherwise I felt pretty good! Getting back into shape quite nicely.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2020-12-10	8:45 AM	Run	Easy	3.08	Mile	0:23:55													Cooldown. God DAMN did I forget how hard Cascades was, especially in the cold which ruins your chest. Went out crazy fast with Andy but managed to stay pretty consistent, which wasn't hard when only doing 3. Definitely going to slow it down next time I do hills so I can do more. Not a bad first workout though!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-11	3:23 PM	Run	Easy	7.05	Mile	0:50:49													First time on Dubois Ridge, awesome gravel road! It has a couple hills but the lack of cars and awesome forest more than make up for it. I'll definitely be coming back here and exploring yellow wood some this break.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-12	9:11 AM	Run	Long	11.05	Mile	1:20:18													Rain got DUMPED on me the last three miles, right as I turned onto third street too which is just one giant puddle when it rains. Still a solid long run though! Legs felt really tired the first 4 or 5 miles, then they seemed to feel about average but I kept it easy the whole way through. I imagine I'll feel better next week after holding mileage. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-14	8:05 AM	Run	Easy	7.03	Mile	0:50:56													Chill run with all the boys on the rail trail, felt a little fast even though it was 7:15.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2020-12-17	9:07 AM	Run	Easy	6.99	Mile	1:01:57													Now this was just some fried ass shit. Did some trail running around griffy with Grace and made a loop out of it. Very slow, but it was pretty fun and managed to get a couple good miles out on the road.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2020-12-18	12:15 PM	Run	Easy	1.75	Mile	0:15:00													Rough estimate of all the cooldown mileage I did during/after the challenge. God DAMN was that shit PAINFUL, but also lots of fun! I definitely surprised myself by hanging on towards the last 5 reps, and even managed to hit a 69 on the last one. Although the rest allowed me to catch my breath every time, my legs got heavier and harder to move after each rep. The wind going into the home stretch was brutal, making the best strategy to bolt down the backstretch and pray to god you don't fall apart after hitting the last turn.<br><br>A very solid, although unorthodox workout, but I think this will for sure be helpful on future quarter repeats. I think it would be pretty easy to hit 74-75's on a minute rest after this, maybe even faster. Awesome work!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-19	11:45 AM	Run	Long	11.16	Mile	1:21:27													AWESOME, although sore, long run on the gravel roads by Yellowwood! Unfortunately it was raining a little so my shoes and car got splashed with gravel but it was still a fun run. No cars, just 7-8 miles of soft gravel. I don't know what it is about gravel but I love it.<br><br>Overall solid week, although some slow distance runs. I figured I'd be feeling better and running faster than I am currently, but this is only my third week back, plus I've had some tough runs that are making me sore like the Hour of Power, hills last week, and Paynetown the week before. Hopefully once I start doing some real workouts I get into shape and feel good!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2020-12-21	9:06 AM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:57:24													Very solid monday run with the boys, still pretty sore from Friday but heart rate was doing just fine. Excited for the first tempo of the season tomorrow!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2020-12-22	10:00 AM	Run	Easy	1.95	Mile	0:14:39													Rooough tempo, legs are still feeling trashed from last Friday. Not a bad effort though, and I guess about as useful as an introductory workout as the fartlek I had planned originally. I'll go ahead and do a 3 mile tempo next week, I imagine I'll feel much better.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2020-12-26	10:21 AM	Run	Long	12.02	Mile	1:23:43													EXCELLENT McGowan-Kent loop with Isaiah, went out trying to reclaim a place on the leaderboard and managed to secure a very solid 7th place. The Devil's Backbone reminded me it was a worthy adversary, but we made no stops this time. Legs are definitely pretty tired but this was awesome! <br><br>Overall this was a pretty chill 50 mile week, but I think I've recovered from the hour of power and can handle some workouts next week. Excited to finally get into workout rhythm!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2020-12-29	3:35 PM	Run	Easy	2.73	Mile	0:20:02													Cooldown. Second week in a row of disappointing tempos, at least I was able to finish this one out. I think I can blame a not-so-good loop, few flat spots and running into the wind for half the loop hurt a surprising amount. It was still a solid effort though, and I felt fine on the cooldown so I don't think I'm over training or anything. Either I'm just not in the shape I thought I was, the loop was tougher than I imagined, or a little bit of both. I'm sure the next one will be better.

2020-12-31	4:00 PM	Run	Easy	0.83	Mile	0:7:03													Cooldown on the track. Fun run and 300's with grace! Legs felt surprisingly awesome today, hopefully they feel this good for the long run this weekend.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-01	3:30 PM	Run	Easy	6.10	Mile	0:43:41													Rainy zionsville rail trail run, didn't feel as good as yesterday but still felt good!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-02	4:11 PM	Run	Long	12.66	Mile	1:28:51													A rather uneventful and unsatisfying run downtown indy by the trails on the river. I missed my original route and had to do some random running. Bummer because I was feeling really good and ready to go quick, but once I missed the route I was a little deflated and said whatever. Overall solid week!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2021-01-05	3:11 PM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:59:14													Felt a little slow on a boltinghouse out and back, but it was a little cold and windy so I forgive myself. The gravel hill wasn't all that bad when compared to the devil's backbone a week ago, legs were sore after but I wasn't nearly as scared of going up than I usually am.

2021-01-06	8:32 AM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:51:38													Another day of my legs feeling like poo poo, this time at morgan monroe with da bois. Probably doesn't help I ran the afternoon before this and the rolling hills were a little brutal. Hopefully I feel better for some intervals tomorrow!

2021-01-07	9:45 AM	Run	Easy	1.00	Mile	0:7:13													Cooldown on the track. Stellar workout, really surprised myself with the pace AND the amount! Originally I figured I would shoot for 12 at 76-77, but 16 at 75 is awesome. This will definitely give me some confidence going into future track workouts. It was nice having Isaiah on the track too, kept me motivated and it was fun cheering each other on.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-08	9:10 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:56:27													Funny how a 7 minute pace run feels quick to me now, but this felt like a quick run as we went to Kerr Creek and back. Kerr hill is not as bad as I thought it would be, but my legs do feel a little beat up. Tomorrow will likely be an easy long run given the workout on Thursday and today. Feeling great otherwise!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-09	9:10 AM	Run	Long	12.02	Mile	1:24:42													An easy going yellow wood loop with Isaiah, legs felt pretty good today although some of the incline got to me. REALLY solid week, had some slower runs before Thursday's workout but it was worth 4 miles of extremely solid pace. I think I'm at a point now where, if I can hold 50 miles a week, I can put most of my focus and energy on workout days. Mileage and long runs put me in little to no deficit, which is excellent this early in the season. Hopefully I can get back into workout shape and run some really solid time trials.

2021-01-11	4:04 PM	Run	Easy	8.09	Mile	0:58:42													First run back at the due, cold and cloudy day on the course. Legs felt pretty good despite all the energy put into moving in!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2021-01-12	1:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.50	Mile	0:10:56													Cooldown. Fucking STELLAR performance today, I really could not have expected a better result today. It helped that I was on relatively flat ground, and that it was sunny and high 30's. There was some wind, which made the 3rd mile near walmart pretty tough, but I managed to hold with a 5:40 and have enough energy at the end to close in a 5:35. I really wanted to run another mile because I felt so good, but it's important to take my time building up workouts and enjoy the process. A million times more happy about this than the tempo 2 weeks ago, so I'm ecstatic!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2021-01-14	2:50 PM	Run	Easy	1.14	Mile	0:8:36													Cooldown back to the house. Felt pretty solid on the workout, averaged about a second faster than I had planned but I can live with that. Excellent workouts this week, lets keep this train going.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-15	4:03 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:57:15													Nice walmart loop, little snowy in the beginning but wore a jacket. Heartrate was crazy low at 142 bpm, guess I'm feeling pretty good!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-16	3:57 PM	Run	Long	12.07	Mile	1:22:16													Fastest long run this season on a good ol' cumberland loop! Heartrate was low, but the legs didn't feel super fresh, which makes sense given the two solid workouts this week. I'll have plenty of rest next week to feel fresh for the workout. <br><br>Overall, this week was incredible! Amazing workouts, solid distance runs, great long run. As long as I stay healthy, this is shaping up to be a pretty damn good season.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-18	3:09 PM	Run	Easy	8.07	Mile	1:00:32													Legs are fuuuuuuuucked after putting in new flooring in my room, but they felt better as the run went along so I think they'll be okay by tomorrow or Wednesday. Looks like weather will be best on Thursday so I'll probably wait until then to do the workout anyways. Time for some chill easy runs the next few days!

2021-01-19	3:37 PM	Run	Easy	8.15	Mile	0:59:41													Brand new loop, can you believe it? Ran all the way down state street until it turned to newman, then turned on river and back up the power plant with a small finish around campus. Legs felt much better today, although I felt like I was going much faster than the pace. No worries though, still got another day before the workout.

2021-01-21	3:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.89	Mile	0:14:28													Long cooldown back to the house. Although I was shooting for a 3:12 average on these K's, I still gotta be pretty happy with how this went! Despite the wind, people on the track that I had to pass, and that voice in my head that said "you know Ben, you could just stop after 6", I still got it done and did what I was supposed to do. Hell, I felt like I could have even done 8, but I'm playing the long game here and don't want to put myself in a deficit.<br><br>Considering I've only done a few workouts of this intensity and distance in the past year, I did fucking great. I may not always hit the desired pace, but as long as I put in the effort and run every rep, I will improve. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-22	3:14 PM	Run	Easy	6.51	Mile	0:47:47													Easy run on the sandy part of the WHT. Legs feeling pretty tired after yesterday, but nothing I can't handle.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-23	3:10 PM	Run	Long	12.01	Mile	1:25:30													Chilled out long run on the nameless rail trail in Lafayette. Decent temperature at 34 and sunny with a slight breeze, allowed me to wear my beloved half tights which I am thankful for. Great week overall, had some awesome recovery runs and an awesome workout. Here's to a good 3k next week!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-25	3:08 PM	Run	Easy	8.06	Mile	0:58:22													Felt loads better today than I did last Monday, that flooring really did a number on me. I'm glad I felt good today though since I'm planning on doing a 5 mile tempo tomorrow, as long as the weather isn't complete shit I'd say I'm good to run it and then go for a hard 3k on Friday!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v1	95.00

2021-01-26	3:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.50	Mile	0:11:10													Cooldown back to the house. Not gonna lie, this tempo was pretty god damn awesome, definitely my best one in quite some time! The Brohm loop is great, although it's basically just a paved track, but it's probably the safest and most reliable tempo route in West Lafayette. It also means I don't have to drive to the parking lot close to the 4 mile bike lane, and I don't want to worry about a few of the subdivision and Walmart entrances/exits. Roads are also pretty busy now that school is in session. Plus, if the loop is good enough for the D1 team, it's good enough for me. Excellent work today!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-27	3:33 PM	Run	Easy	7.42	Mile	0:53:23													Easy going on a cold and slightly windy day, did a short loop around 231, by the grand prix course, to the IM fields and did a couple loops. Legs were definitely a little angry at me after yesterday, but I'll be golden by Friday.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-28	3:16 PM	Run	Easy	7.04	Mile	0:50:14													Pretty nice day outside, although a little cold. Did a happy hollow loop in some new ~chromatic~ shoes. Legs felt great, and I'm ready for tomorrow's 3k!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00

2021-01-29	2:41 PM	Run	Easy	4.06	Mile	0:30:46													Cooldown on trails and sidewalks near the track. Not a bad time trial, not a great one either, but I'm proud of myself for having the balls to run a 3K by myself when it's 36 degrees outside after a 5 mile tempo on Tuesday. I was hesitant to even call this a time trial since I didn't want to disappoint myself if I did badly, but I was feeling really good beforehand and thought I could go for a sub 9:30. Obviously I wasn't too far off, and I think if I had a proper down week the week of I could do much better. Good start to see what kind of shape I'm in, I can only go up from here!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-01-30	3:35 PM	Run	Long	12.01	Mile	1:24:18													Sweet yet snowy long run out to the country roads outside West Lafayette. Legs felt really good after the time trial yesterday! Awesome week over all, the time trial wasn't everything I had hoped for but the tempo and easy runs went well. 6 weeks in a row of 50!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-02-01	3:14 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:58:05													I really lucked out with the massive snow being on a Sunday, I could at least manage doing 2 campus loops without much trouble at all besides groups of people being in the way. Felt kinda blegh today before the run, but legs and breathing felt excellent, even after a solid week of training last week! Hopefully I'm able to stick to my training plan for the most part this next month, it always gets rough when it starts to snow a shit ton and temps drop hard.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-02	3:37 PM	Run	Easy	8.10	Mile	0:57:44													By the grace of Happy Hollow, I was able to find a decent enough 8 mile loop to run on. Little sketch on some parts and almost ate shit by the park, by it worked out and the legs felt pretty good!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-03	3:57 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:49:41													Ran by the track to do some mile repeats since it was nice out and the legs were feeling good, but there wasn't a single lane plowed :( ended up with a solid distance run, hopefully after some rain tomorrow the snow will clear up but if not I'll change it to a hard fartlek.

2021-02-04	4:30 PM	Run	Easy	1.45	Mile	0:10:50													Cooldown back to the house. I actually would have preferred the original mile repeats track workout since I felt really good today, but with the snow covered track it just wouldn't be possible. Sucks that weather brought me down a little, but this was still a good workout! I'm happy I managed to go under 5:30 pace for every rep, especially after an incredible 5 minute on that I busted my ass on. Here's to better weather (colder but less snow) next week!

2021-02-05	4:17 PM	Run	Easy	7.10	Mile	0:49:16													Solid easy run on a 231-Walmart loop. Feeling really good after the fartlek yesterday!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99								
2021-02-06	2:27 PM	Run	Long	12.00	Mile	1:23:53													Went on a 231-Happy Hollow loop. Not gonna lie, partied a little too hard last night and I definitely felt it on this run. Didn't help that I've had little to no food the past 24 hours, stomach was hurtin right after this one. But, still managed to pull this out of my ass! I swear, sometimes I'm a physical specimen.<br><br>Overall really solid week in terms of distance runs, the fartlek was good for what it was but I'm sad I couldn't do miles on the track. Hopefully by the time I do my next track workout there will be at least one lane somewhere I can run on.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2021-02-09	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	1.90	Mile	0:14:15													Cooldown in between the 5K's and after. Another insanely awesome tempo!! I'm actually surprised how good I felt on this one, wasn't sure after the first 5k but once I came out of the gates with a 5:32 on the second one I realized this was gonna be an awesome workout. Definitely pushed past tempo pace towards the end of the second 5k, but that was the point of the workout, to gain some confidence for the last few miles of a future 10k tempo. <br><br>Just in general, my legs have been feeling extremely fresh the past few weeks, I'm really excited to see what I can do on a track once all this snow clears up. Really getting into shape here!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-10	4:05 PM	Run	Easy	7.03	Mile	0:51:46													Legs were definitely pretty tired today on a Walmart loop. Didn't help that it was windy and snowy as well, but I took it easy since I did so well yesterday.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-11	4:00 PM	Run	Easy	7.04	Mile	0:50:45													Had a short tune up workout planned for today, but the track is still snowed out and my legs are fairly sore from Tuesday still. Plus, with a slight covid scare in the house, maybe it wouldn't be best to stress my body. Despite all my pussy ass excuses, still had a solid distance run today on a salisbury loop. Fuck all this snow though bro.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00

2021-02-12	4:50 PM	Run	Easy	1.16	Mile	0:8:31													Cooldown back to the house. Intervals on the track would have been more fun, but I had a good time on this fartlek. Pacing generally got faster each rep, probably just because of loosening up. Legs felt solid today, much better than the last few days!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-13	3:25 PM	Run	Long	12.03	Mile	1:20:56													Another awesome long run, this time up the bike path past Walmart, into some neighborhoods, onto a country road, and back on Salisbury. Dropped a spicy 5:36 last mile, just felt like pushing it a little. Didn't feel incredible at the start of the run, but I eased into 6:40-6:30 pace and I felt great! Can't wait for it to warm up a little and for some sun to maybe show.<br><br>Overall incredible week, lots of good runs to be proud of! This also marks 2 full months of 50 miles per week, I'm very proud of how consistent I've been training and making sure I'm healthy by taking my easy days easy. Come Spring time, I think I'll have some very kick ass time trials and have something to show for all the work I've been putting in the last year.

2021-02-15	2:03 PM	Run	Easy	8.16	Mile	1:00:10													Ran early today to escape the incoming shitshow of snow, on the bright side it forced me to go slow! Legs felt pretty solid today even after a quick week last week, all I have planned this week are some mile repeats, which it looks like I'll have to do on the Brohm loop.

2021-02-16	2:05 PM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:57:59													Chill baby campus loops, first one with mike the dyke. Legs and breathing felt very good today, and the bike lanes were actually more clear than the roads!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-17	3:11 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:50:14													Actually felt really good today, but the happy hollow loop I went on was VERY unshoveled at most sidewalks, looking at you northwestern and river road. But, it was still nice not doing campus loops for the third day in a row.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00

2021-02-18	4:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.87	Mile	0:14:34													Cooldown mileage and mileage inbetween reps. At first I was let down by how I felt after the third rep since I really wanted a fourth, but honestly my times went above and beyond my initial expectations! I did not think I had anything like that in me for road miles in 23 degree weather, with slight wind and slush. Definitely far from ideal conditions and terrain, but the fact I was able to bust out a 5:06 mile after a 5:11 and 5:10, that gives me a lot of confidence for a future 5k. That is without a doubt sub 16 potential right there. Not to mention, 8 really good 200's was a nice cherry on top. Solid work today bub, next workout will be on a track and I'll be blazin.

2021-02-19	4:42 PM	Run	Easy	7.91	Mile	0:57:26													Nice lil walmart-salisbury loop, the unshoveled sidewalks really pissed me off today but only one more day of this shit! I'm so fucking excited for warmer, non-snowy weather it's insane.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-20	3:30 PM	Run	Long	12.00	Mile	1:23:36													THE FROZEN WASTELAND IS MELTING! YOU WON'T BE MISSED YOU FUCKING HELLHOLE! Got hard rerouted twice, so made up a wonky loop. Went up the happy hollow road hill for the first time and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, definitely very long though and I felt it. 187 feet of elevation on that mile :o<br><br>Overall this was a pretty solid week, lots of frustration on the routes with a shit ton of snow on the sidewalks. I also really miss being able to run workouts on the track, hopefully they're clear next week. Let's keep it up! 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-22	4:06 PM	Run	Easy	8.08	Mile	0:58:35													37 DEGREES AND SUNNY! Felt happy today on the run, although legs were a little tired on a still slightly slushy Walmart loop. Can't wait for all these 40 degree days.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v2	89.99

2021-02-23	4:30 PM	Run	Easy	1.35	Mile	0:9:41													Beautiful fucking day out, 47 and sunny, but unfortunately I think the sudden heating up affected me a little bit as my legs felt pretty tired. I'm also still likely recovering from last week. Hopefully by Friday I feel good again and am adapted to the weather! Still a solid workout today, managed to hit slightly faster than tempo pace.

2021-02-24	2:46 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:51:09													Legs are still oddly trashed on a 231-salisbury loop, but my heartrate was typical. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-25	3:34 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:50:55													Felt a little less sore today on a happy hollow road loop, the trail was closed for construction :( Still felt a little off though, but I think I'll feel pretty good tomorrow!

2021-02-26	3:53 PM	Run	Easy	3.90	Mile	0:28:35													Cooldown campus loop after driving back. <br><br>I'm disappointed again in this race. I was so close to at least a PR that this one hurts more than the 9:42, especially after what I thought was a really solid month of training. I was at a 8:56-8:57 on the last 200, and I honestly gave it my all to try and run a 33-34, but it just wasn't enough. On the bright side, my splits looked much better than the last 3k, which bodes well I suppose. <br><br>In the end it just sucks that I have no opportunities to race. Had I been on an indoor track, around runners of similar ability, I bet this would have been a pretty good day for me. Being alone on a windy track just isn't the same. I'm worried that I won't have the ability to go under 16 in a 5K like I originally set out to do, it may just be too difficult to do on my own. <br><br>With that being said, I do think I need to focus more on interval work. One hard workout every 2 weeks isn't cutting it for what I want to achieve it seems. Hopefully in the next 2-3 months, with more interval volume and the now track-friendly weather, I'll be able to build up some speed. I have an incredibly solid base it seems, just need to work on the hard stuff. Let's get to it baby.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-02-27	3:15 PM	Run	Long	12.08	Mile	1:27:39													Chill Twyck greenway out and back. Breathing was excellent on this warm day, legs not so much. They were definitely pretty sore but I worked down to low 7 minute pace towards the end after the first 5 or so miles being around 7:20. Solid recovery long run.<br><br>Overall, this week was a little more painful than I was expecting, but with the sudden weather change I guess it could have gone a lot worse. It's probably best to just run how I feel the next next or two given I need to adapt to the warmth, hopefully after that I can rip some workouts with ease.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-01	4:03 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	1:00:17													First slow grassy day since the big snows! Legs felt totally fine, just wanted to take it easy today after a tough week last week. The XC course was a no go, so I ended up doing probably 5-6 IM field loops. The soft surface was nice though, I hope the course is in better condition next week.

2021-03-02	4:00 PM	Run	Easy	1.29	Mile	0:9:19													Cooldown. I actually can't believe how well I've been running tempos this semester, this tempo was fucking awesome!! I was pretty intimidated by the thought of running 6+ tempo miles all in a row, especially since I remember the pain I was in last time I ran a 30 minute tempo a few years ago. The lactate didn't hit me until about 5.25 miles in, but that's when I started to go a little quicker so I was ready for it. The last quarter mile was definitely pretty painful, but about the same as the last quarter mile of my 5 mile tempo. It's really cool to see the kind of progress I've made in the distance of my tempos, every time I had a mile it's only the last mile where I begin to feel it.<br><br>Here's to a great introduction to Spring training, let's keep it going!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-03	4:36 PM	Run	Easy	7.13	Mile	0:52:31													First 60 degree day of the season! Got to wear a singlet, although my arms were definitely a little chilly when going into the wind, but it could have been worse. Legs were also pretty trashed after yesterday's tempo, but I was expecting it. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-04	4:03 PM	Run	Easy	7.23	Mile	0:52:24													I wanted to do some 400's today, but the community track was fucking PACKED. I guess I'll drive to the WL track tomorrow and do them. It's probably for the best since my legs were still pretty shot today, didn't help that my weird route had a bunch of hills, but it was kinda fun feeling like I was back in B-town.

2021-03-05	3:40 PM	Run	Easy	2.63	Mile	0:19:37													Warmup around the bike trails n shit. Really solid workout, legs are definitely still recovering from Tuesday's tempo, but this workout wasn't meant to overload on volume so I think they'll be ok. Awesome pacing for every rep, got faster on every one!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-06	4:02 PM	Run	Long	12.01	Mile	1:25:41													Went DEEP into lafayette for this one to get to Munger Trail. It was an alright route, had to cross a couple big streets but new routes are always fun. I felt crazy good considering the amount of beers I chugged last night for beer olympics, and the short workout I did yesterday. The weather was also perfect, 50 and sunny! Unfortunately the rainbow shoes took a hit when I crossed the mud path on the WHT :(<br><br>Overall, this week of training was incredible, the kind of shit I need more of if I want to break 16! My easy days were easy, and my workout days were tough, with a total of ~8.5 workout miles. I'll probably stick to just one tough interval workout next week, but if I gut it out this next month and keep up the workouts I'll be in good shape.

2021-03-08	3:22 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:58:32													XC course is still sloshed to fuck, so I did more IM field loops today. It was warm enough to make me shave my chest and go SHIRTLESS with HALFTIGHTS!!!! I felt like the greek god that I am today, although I will admit the warmth (of only 66 degrees) wore me out a little. Legs still felt extremely solid after an amazing work of week last week.

2021-03-09	4:39 PM	Run	Easy	2.04	Mile	0:14:52													Warmup to the track, had to start late so I could get there after the damn kids were gone				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00

2021-03-09	5:40 PM	Run	Easy	1.56	Mile	0:12:50													Longish cooldown back to the house. God damn dude, I actually can't believe I felt this fucking good on a Tuesday with 70 degree weather and some heavy wind! I was really hoping for 9 or 10 reps, but man, right around 4 or 5 I was really starting to feel the pace and I knew 8 was gonna be tough. My legs were wobbling hard on the 7th rep and it took the rest of my courage to even start the 8th one, and I'm damn proud that I finished with a 2:33.<br><br>This is easily my best interval workout since the K's I did in January, and those were a tad bit slower (5:13 pace vs 5:08 pace) in much colder, and probably easier to run in, weather. The more I can do shit like this, the closer I get to running a sub 16. The next two days will definitely be easy days, but hopefully on Friday I can do another shorter workout like I did last week. I think that would be an excellent rhythm these last few months of track to get myself into good shape.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-10	4:56 PM	Run	Easy	7.39	Mile	0:55:24													Legs were definitely a little sore on this windy day. Had a very nice recovery run down the southern part of the WHT, it was surprisingly clear and dry! It was nice to have a little soft surface.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-11	3:54 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:57:13													Beautiful day for a 231-salisbury loop, legs felt great too! Yesterday's easy day paid off it seems, I think I'll go for some slight 200's tomorrow.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00

2021-03-12	12:45 PM	Run	Easy	3.48	Mile	0:25:44													Cooldown plus the offs, which were right at ~55 seconds each, exactly what I was going for. This workout was solid, definitely harder than I was expecting as I was pretty gassed by rep 10. But, this is my first week of two interval workouts, and they both went really well! Hopefully in the coming weeks I can push my total interval mileage per week to about 6-7, I'm at 5.5 for this week and I feel pretty healthy. Great day!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-13	2:59 PM	Run	Long	12.19	Mile	1:18:15													There must have been something in the cheesecake factory meal I had yesterday, because god fucking damn I don't know where this came from, literally the best long run I have ever had if we're just looking at raw pace and how good I felt!!! Probably helped that zionsville is flat as hell, but there were a few hills here and there that made me work for it. I was hitting good pace the entire time, but when I ran a 6:13 9th mile and barely felt it I knew I was feeling good, so I decided to tempo the last two miles and I hit a 5:47 and 5:28, pretty bonkers. <br><br>Overall this was another really solid week, 2 solid workouts and a crazy good long run. Excited for some more good workouts next week, and then my first 5k time trial the week after! If I can maintain the work I've been putting in the past 2 weeks, I'll be in for some good shit.

2021-03-15	5:34 PM	Run	Easy	8.05	Mile	0:58:44													Easy walmart loop since it's been rainy and cold as fuck all day, the XC course was out of the question.

2021-03-16	3:00 PM	Run	Easy	0.52	Mile	0:3:56													Short cooldown after the workout, also on the track. This workout was about as hard as I expected it would be, but I'm pretty proud of myself here. A little disappointed I didn't break 5 in the 1600, but a 5:01 is the next best thing so hell yeah. The 1200 also could have been a few seconds faster but I never know how to pace myself for a 1200. The 800 and 400 were excellent, as were all of the tempo 1600s. All in all, awesome hybrid tempo/interval workout, legs are definitely feeling this one already so it was a success for sure.<br><br>I also have to keep in mind I've really increased my workout load these past few weeks, so the fact that I'm still able to handle a workout like this as well as I did is impressive. Maintaining mileage for this long definitely seems to be paying off, as well as running 6 days a week as opposed to 7. I'll have a slight down week next week in terms of workouts to recoup, so I should be able to keep up this rhythm through April.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00

2021-03-20	3:47 PM	Run	Long	12.05	Mile	1:24:00													Legs definitely didn't feel as good this week as last week, but I don't think I can expect that much from my legs every Saturday. They were a little shaky today, probably from the workout yesterday and especially the quick cooldown. After a few miles though they felt alright and I cruised at a solid pace on a beautiful day! Went all the way down the bike lane and back, with a few IM loops to get another mile.<br><br>Overall this was another incredible week of training, good easy runs, good workouts, and another good long run!

2021-03-23	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.23	Mile	0:9:13													It was a rough one out there today, I thought my watch was fucked up when I ran a 8:00 warm up mile but nah, I just felt that bad today. Legs were murked by the first 3' rep of the fartlek, and I had to take a few minutes to catch my breath after the second 1' rep. I almost quit the workout, but the thought of messing up my beautiful streak of workouts and mileage kept me going. Finished fairly smooth thankfully, but my legs are definitely tired now.<br><br>I guess I'll just take it easy the next few days and see if my legs are up for a time trial on Friday. If not, no big deal, I can just take this week as a down week and pick training back up as planned next week. At least today I got the workout done, that's better than some days.

2021-03-25	5:29 PM	Run	Easy	7.15	Mile	0:53:14													I guess my legs were feeling better today? Felt really good the first mile and opened up with a 7:35, then pretty much stayed that pace the whole time because I could feel my legs were still a little angry. I definitely didn't feel worse, which is nice, and my heartrate was pretty low the entire time. It was a fun day in the rain on a happy hollow loop, got pretty soaked towards the end but thankfully didn't have to run into the wind that much.

2021-03-26	4:56 PM	Run	Easy	5.04	Mile	0:38:14													The day has finally come, the day where I commit to taking a down week. I had a time trial planned for today, but given my legs have felt like shit since Monday, I think this is completely necessary. Thankfully this came at a good time since I've gone very hard on workouts the past 3 weeks, so a down week on the 4th week makes sense. Hopefully I can manage to run 50 again next week with some workouts, we'll see how tomorrow and Monday go.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-27	4:27 PM	Run	Long	9.08	Mile	1:04:05													The deed has been done, the 13 week streak has been broken. It had to happen though, and thankfully my legs felt MUCH better today! It was about 75 out so the heat wore me out a little, and I kicked harder than I wanted towards the end because of a guy on a bike who went with me for the last few miles. It was fun talking to him though!<br><br>All in all, I'm sad I couldn't run my time trial this week, but I believe it's for the greater good. Hopefully next week I'll be recovered enough to run some workouts and hope for a time trial at the end of April.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-29	6:38 PM	Run	Easy	8.20	Mile	1:00:32													A late evening Monday 8 on an extended Walmart loop. Legs were a little tired from the doggy day out and waking up early, but I definitely felt way better today than I did last Monday, which is a great sign!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-30	3:45 PM	Run	Easy	2.10	Mile	0:15:24													Warmup to the Brohm loop				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-30	4:15 PM	Run	Interval	4.00	Mile	0:21:36													4 x mile with 90" rest on the Brohm loop<br><br>5:32/5:25/5:20/5:19				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-30	4:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.79	Mile	0:13:40													Cooldown. Did this workout with Paul and Alex, had much harder mile repeats in mind but after the forced down week last week I think this was for the best. I felt pretty shitty in the beginning, but great on the last repeat and probably could have gone for another, but we stopped. All in all, good first workout back, I think I can do better next week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-03-31	5:14 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:50:46													A chilly and windy Happy Hallow loop, legs were definitely sore from yesterday, but not super fatigued. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-01	1:22 PM	Run	Easy	8.26	Mile	1:03:01													Slow recovery run with Paul and Alex, did a bunch of loops and legs felt pretty good, although still pretty sore.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-02	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	2.04	Mile	0:14:51													Warmup to the track<br>				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-02	5:30 PM	Run	Interval	1.50	Mile	0:7:20													2 x (200, 400, 600) with 200 jog in between each rep, on the track<br><br>35/74/1:50<br>36/74/1:51				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-02	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	3.23	Mile	0:24:49													Cooldown after the workout, plus 200 jogs. This workout was quite a bit tougher than I had expected, was planning on doing 3 sets but the 600's really wore down on my legs. This was probably a good segway back into speed though after 2 weeks of pretty slow mileage, hopefully next week I'm back to 100%!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-03	4:24 PM	Run	Long	12.09	Mile	1:27:06													Nice Cumberland-Happy Hollow action on a bright and sunny day, legs felt good but definitely feeling a little beat up. Maybe I partied a little too hard last night, only got 7 hours of sleep, but feeling fine otherwise.<br><br>Overall not exactly what I expected from this week's training. I was hoping I would feel a lot better than this after a down week, but maybe I'm just falling to late season fatigue. Hopefully I can pump out a few more good workouts and keep mileage up, but I'm already looking forward to next season without much optimism for this one. I was really hoping to have some 5k's opening up but it seems I will be without one. Still though, my mileage and workout consistency has been waaaay better than last fall, so no matter what every week is a step forward.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-05	9:43 AM	Run	Easy	8.10	Mile	0:58:39													Needed a nice morning run today, and I got exactly what I needed! Legs were a little sauced but hopefully in a few days of running in the morning they'll feel better.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-06	9:44 PM	Run	Easy	7.03	Mile	0:50:10													Another late morning run, this time up the bike path for a shortened bog loop and then around Walmart. It was a little spicy out and the wine last night definitely got me dehydrated, but still felt surprisingly good.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-07	9:35 AM	Run	Easy	8.06	Mile	0:56:09													Went on a 231-Walmart loop, legs were a little worn out but I think that's from being a little dehydrated and still getting used to running in the morning. This was also a rare run where I wish I hit more red lights than green lights, but every single light was green god dammit				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-08	9:47 AM	Run	Easy	5.47	Mile	0:41:35													Legs were pretty tired on a short happy hollow loop, gonna run a time trial tomorrow and see how it goes! New pair of reeboks felt pretty good.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-04-09	9:58 AM	Run	Easy	1.01	Mile	0:7:31													Warmup to the track. Didn't record my cooldown after, so here's how the 5k went. I was shooting for a progression, mostly to motivate myself to go faster at the end, but it just didn't happen. My legs are definitely far past overtraining, if the garmin heartrate is correct then I was 12 minutes in Zone 5, the redzone. Given my lack of motivation to run this week as well, it's safe to say it's time for a break.<br><br>Obviously this season didn't end like I wanted it to, but I have to be very pleased with the mileage I held for over four months! This is definitely the most consistent I have ever stayed in my life, and I think I can take lessons from this season and carry them forward for the summer and fall. I still have some stuff to figure out, but I got at least a few decades to perfect this machine of mine. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-04-22	3:38 PM	Run	Easy	3.00	Mile	0:23:30													Explored the horticulture park today on my first run back in almost 2 weeks. Played a solid hour and a half of tennis before this so legs were already a little wobbly, but I felt pretty good! Just gonna take it easy the next week and a half and go for short 3, 4 mile runs.

2021-04-24	1:57 PM	Run	Easy	4.11	Mile	0:29:31													Lil pre-bars bday run, legs felt good on a campus loop.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-04-27	5:03 PM	Run	Easy	4.08	Mile	0:31:45													2 x Horticulture loop today, and I didn't fall once! Definitely felt pretty tired on the second loop and on the way back, but it was also a steamy 85 degrees today, which I am definitely not used to.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-28	4:45 PM	Run	Easy	4.05	Mile	0:29:14													Drizzly cherry lane loop, legs felt pretty good today.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-04-29	2:33 PM	Run	Easy	4.20	Mile	0:31:09													COURSE KING OF HORTICULTURE LOOP BABY! Three days in and I'm already setting records. I definitely could have gone way faster but it was muddy as hell, and I fell on my ass once, but got right back up. I'll probably head back sometime later when it's dry and set an even faster time. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-04-30	8:32 PM	Run	Easy	4.02	Mile	0:29:11													Easy neighborhood running, ran late because I was hungover as fuck.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-01	6:54 PM	Run	Easy	5.09	Mile	0:35:54													Post second vax, post volleyball darty happy hollow NORTHBOUND loop! Tried to see if a solid effort run would get me on the leader-board for the segment, and I tied for third! My legs were definitely a little tired from stuff earlier in the day, and the heat sucked, but I'm surprised I placed. 1st place might be out of reach, a whole 40ish seconds faster than what I ran. Even if I was in good shape, that would be very tough.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-03	4:32 PM	Run	Easy	5.20	Mile	0:38:15													Some IM and course running, lil soggy but no worries.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-05-04	4:16 PM	Run	Easy	6.30	Mile	0:44:42													Hard bog effort, managed to snag a crown but not the one I really wanted, although I was only 6 seconds off! I can definitely get it next time I go for it, especially when my legs feel a little more stable. They were pretty wobbly today so I'm going to stop going for segments for the next week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00

2021-05-10	12:23 PM	Run	Easy	5.16	Mile	0:37:42													A jog in the hood before I head back to Purdue, didn't do my long run last week because I was hungover until about 7 pm on Saturday, and had no desire on Sunday. I'm hoping I feel better next week and actually have the desire to run, something I didn't have last week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-11	4:06 PM	Run	Easy	5.03	Mile	0:36:50													A nice lagoon loop.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-12	4:21 PM	Run	Easy	5.02	Mile	0:36:22													Another hood run, BUT THIS TIME WITH A NEW GRAVEL ROAD!!! It's very close to a half mile long (out to a private road sign), and I fucking love it. This might actually be enough to excite me in running in the hood more.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-13	2:44 PM	Run	Easy	6.03	Mile	0:42:06													A nice solo run on the B-line after going to the BMV, I don't like how long a 6 mile run feels like now. At least the pace was smooth!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-14	9:05 AM	Run	Easy	5.09	Mile	0:37:17													Ran downtown by bloomingfoods with Grace, early run had my legs tired 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-15	9:58 AM	Run	Long	9.03	Mile	1:04:41													First long run in quite some time, and god damn were my legs feeling it, especially with the hills of high street! Did a nice Olcott loop, overall I think a good first week truly back and I'm feeling much more excited to get back into shape than I was last week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-05-20	9:00 AM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:43:00													A tough day on the XC course, between heat and hills/grass I was feeling this in my legs and my lungs. 7 minute pace on the course is tufff				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-05-21	8:13 AM	Run	Easy	6.01	Mile	0:45:18													Easy loop for a day off, legs felt pretty good today				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-22	8:35 AM	Run	Long	10.00	Mile	1:08:44													Really smooth long run with Isaac at the Morgan Monroe state forest! Besides all the fucking flies that were flying around us, this was super nice. Felt really good at the end and dropped a sub 6 mile, fastest of the season so far.

2021-05-26	7:53 AM	Run	Easy	6.03	Mile	0:43:44													Did some exploring today on the gun range road, giant fucking hill but I got 7th on the strava leaderboard B)<br>Legs are feeling pretty good today! I'm ready to start my "Summer of Hills" with some 7 am Cascades repeats tomorrow				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-27	7:00 AM	Run	Easy	3.09	Mile	0:21:59													Eaaarly warmup for some hills baby				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-05-27	7:45 AM	Run	Easy	2.19	Mile	0:16:41													Cooldown with some mile loops. Went out CRAZY quick on the first one and definitely paid for it on the last two, but I still felt pretty good! I'm excited for more hills				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-28	9:14 AM	Run	Easy	6.02	Mile	0:44:12													Easy going loop from hillside to 3rd street, legs felt a little beat up the first half but got better in the second!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-29	8:52 AM	Run	Long	10.01	Mile	1:05:51													KICK ASS long run from Sare, to Winslow, to the B-Line, then back on 10th. Started to really pick it up on the windy and slightly uphill B-line, closed in a tough 5:51. Only had a stop once at a light!<br><br>Overall this was a really solid week, good recovery runs, a good hill workout, and a really incredible long run for this early in the season. I think if I alternate weeks where I do a tempo and a hard long run, I won't run the risk of burning out. Feeling good and confident!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-05-31	8:39 AM	Run	Easy	7.12	Mile	0:53:23													Two Lake Gage loops, felt pretty good! A little bit of elevation gain here and there, but it wasn't too bad. The houses were and lake were pretty!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-01	8:46 AM	Run	Easy	2.03	Mile	0:14:51													Warmup down kinser and back				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-01	9:15 AM	Run	Tempo	2.60	Mile	0:15:02													15' tempo on the midsummer course<br><br>5:46/5:45/3:30 (5:51 pace)				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-01	9:30 AM	Run	Easy	2.38	Mile	0:17:30													Cooldown down the other side of kinser. If I'm being honest, this tempo smacked my ass hard. I was expecting a somewhat trivial 5k, but the second coming of Prow had other plans for me. I made it right at the top of the drive around Hoosier Hills and called it at 15 minutes because I was slowing down pretty hard. I could have finished it, but it was not a tempo at that point (HR was also 190 for that last .6). So, lesson learned: do not underestimate the midsummer loop!<br><br>With that being said, I think this was a great first tempo and I look forward to doing a 3-4 mile tempo next time after I have some more cascades repeats and mileage under my belt. I think I was just a little under prepared for today.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-06-03	8:00 AM	Run	Easy	1.91	Mile	0:14:48													Cooldown. My legs were fucking toasted after these hills, again we went out pretty quick and held on, even raced Andy slightly on the last one and really felt it. I had to cut off my mileage for the day at 6 because I was seeing some stars at the end of the run, that's when you know it's a good workout ;)				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-04	8:36 AM	Run	Easy	8.10	Mile	0:58:19													Really nice morning run from North! Legs felt great after yesterday's hills, plus it was a beautiful sunny day.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-06	8:05 AM	Run	Long	11.00	Mile	1:08:44													Fastest long run of my life, and I wasn't even expecting it! This was all thanks to Andy and Isaac who took me out on 446, which was actually a really flat road for the occasion. Really started to feel it after 9 miles, but managed to drop a 5:57 by myself on the last mile. Really surprised by how well I held up, I guess I'm in better shape than I thought!<br><br>Overall this was an incredible week, I didn't expect to feel as good as I did after a tempo on Tuesday, hills on Thursday, and an awesome long run today. Next week will be easier, but I need some weeks like that to keep from burning out. I'm excited for what's to come!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-07	8:42 AM	Run	Easy	8.37	Mile	1:01:53													Yeah my legs are tired, went a little over on an Olcott loop since High street was closed				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-08	7:54 AM	Run	Easy	8.07	Mile	0:57:00													A rather quick downtown loop with Grace, my legs were feeling it on the hills but felt a lot better than I would have expected after yesterday!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-09	9:24 AM	Run	Easy	7.03	Mile	0:52:36													A humid but peaceful earl young road run, felt like I was jogging up the hill but was FOUR SECONDS OFF the segment record! Kinda pissed that I was that close and didn't even know it, but now in 2 weeks I know I can demolish it if I actually go hard. That segment is mine bitch				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-06-10	7:45 AM	Run	Easy	1.55	Mile	0:11:47													Cooldown back up to and around north. Legs were definitely a little flat today, and Isaac and Andy stopped at 4 so I did too. They weren't as quick as last week, but I felt a lot better afterwards than I did last time. I prefer keeping it low 60's than what I've been doing previously, so I think I'll stick with it as I move up. Good workout!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-11	8:38 AM	Run	Easy	8.04	Mile	0:57:58													FOUR FUCKING 2K LOOPS AT THE IU XC COURSE. My legs are in pain, but my spirit is enlightened.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-06-12	8:25 AM	Run	Long	12.12	Mile	1:25:50													Another good ol' Yellowwood loop, I totally forgot that there was a shit ton of elevation gain (866 ft) and it rocked my ass in the first half of the run. Felt much smoother towards the end, although I could tell I was running out of gas. Still somewhat recovering from some tough runs this week I think.<br><br>Overall, this week was about what I expected after last week. Some very solid distance runs, a good hill workout, and a much more relaxed LR that still kind of hurt. Hopefully next week I feel a little more loose since I'll be holding mileage.

2021-06-14	8:47 AM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:58:24													A slight variation of the Sare loop, legs felt really good today! It seems like last week didn't bang me up too bad. Excited for some workouts this week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-06-15	8:00 AM	Run	Easy	1.96	Mile	0:14:40													Cooldown after the workout. Really solid tempo runs with Isaac and Andy, got dropped on the second one and slowed down a little but still hung in there. Definitely felt this one afterwards too, but this was way better quantity and quality than the Midsummer tempo I did last Tuesday.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-16	8:38 AM	Run	Easy	6.63	Mile	0:50:41													Legs felt roughhh today on a knightridge road out and back. Breathing was alright, so I'm not too worried about fatigue. The route was nice otherwise!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-06-17	7:55 AM	Run	Easy	1.75	Mile	0:12:56													Cooldown back to North. Legs actually didn't feel too bad today, but the guys took it slow so I did too. Last one was definitely a lot of work so it's probably good we went easy the first few, managed to beat Andy by a few seconds (although he had me slightly on a few of the early ones). All in all another good hill workout.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-18	7:45 AM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:59:32													Gave my legs a break on the rail trail, heart rate was great but the legs were definitely a little tired. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-19	7:34 AM	Run	Long	12.10	Mile	1:19:54													Awesome cutdown long run workout on the 231 highway trail with a walmart bike trail loop in the middle<br><br>First 4 miles: 7:10 avg<br>Middle 4 miles: 6:38 avg<br>Last 4 miles: 6:02 avg<br><br>Felt really good all the way through, the last 4 miles definitely required some grit but dropped a steaming 5:45 at the end! Best week of training so far this summer, looking forward to a well earned down week next week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-21	8:52 AM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:44:52													I was really excited for my first down week run until about 3 miles in where fucking TERRIBLE cramps hit me and didn't stop coming. I had to stop at walk around for probably 10 minutes just to get one particularly nasty one in my lower left abdomen out. Still a good chill recovery run!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-22	8:40 AM	Run	Easy	7.02	Mile	0:50:47													Really smooth earl young out and back, and snagged the segment crown for the gravel hill! My throat and chest still hurt after the hard effort, legs were completely full of acid and couldn't move at the apex of the hill. I still managed to move pretty quick to the end of the segment, which is a little after the turn into the benton neighborhood.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-23	8:56 AM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:43:22													Nice little loop, legs felt a little tired from yesterday's one hill, but heart rate was excellent!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-06-24	7:45 AM	Run	Easy	1.28	Mile	0:9:52													Cooldown back to north. Legs were definitely still worn out from Tuesday's single hill sprint, but I still got the job done today. Managed to do one more than Andy and Isaac, although I was definitely slower than them. Great work though, it's easy to take hill workouts for granted but 6 cascades in no joke. Onto the next one!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-25	8:01 AM	Run	Easy	6.16	Mile	0:45:09													Got some flat ground in at the rail trail, although there was some construction a little before the roundabout so I had to take a weird route.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-27	8:39 AM	Run	Long	10.01	Mile	1:13:17													Legs were exhausted after the cedar point excursion, they felt much better after 4-5 miles but going up hills was still tough. Did 3 loops around Lake Gage and it actually never got boring, super nice roads and not a lot of people out! Overall this was a great down week, easy mileage and a solid hill workout. I'm a little worried about my cedar point legs going into next week but even then it's not a super difficult week, just some workouts. The second half of the summer is now beginning, here we go!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-28	8:41 AM	Run	Easy	8.13	Mile	0:59:06													Nice easy Olcott loop, but I was still feeling tired up some rather large hills and in 75 degree heat.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-06-29	9:00 AM	Run	Easy	2.44	Mile	0:18:47													Cooldown back to north. Legs were still rough today, but we got it done. Hopefully after tomorrow's easy day I'm feeling good for the tempo on Thursday.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-06-30	7:53 AM	Run	Easy	7.26	Mile	0:54:33													Simplistic easy run with Grace on a Iverness woods out and back, legs are definitely a little tired today but felt good after this recovery run!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-07-01	9:03 AM	Run	Easy	2.10	Mile	0:15:12													Warmup for the tempo				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-07-01	9:45 AM	Run	Easy	0.61	Mile	0:4:37													Really frustrated after this tempo. It seems like every time I try to be careful and slow myself down, such as the planned down week anyways, I end up getting fatigued anyways. Haven't had a solid tempo all summer, and I feel slow on all my easy runs. Gonna take a few days off and move around some stuff on the training plan.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-05	9:12 AM	Run	Easy	6.05	Mile	0:45:00													Nice and easy Olcott loop. Legs are feeling a little better, but still took it easy. I'm hoping the few days off resets whatever my legs were going through because they were hurtin bad last week. Im thinking about cutting out hills in the future because I think that hurts them the most. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-06	9:30 AM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:43:07													Easy run in the neighborhood, went down the Arnold private drive and jesus christ is it hilly. Legs are feeling good though!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-07	10:30 AM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:49:09													First run on Michigan, ran down a newly paved Lakeshore road. Legs are feeling even better today, although the humidity and heat (80 degrees) wore me out a little.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-08	10:15 AM	Run	Easy	7.03	Mile	0:49:47													Another great run on Warren Woods road, legs were feeling slightly less spicy but heartrate was low! Did 6 x strides after on the gravel driveway.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-09	9:58 AM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:49:54													Explored a new road today and took a dump in the woods! Legs still holding up pretty well.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-10	10:15 AM	Run	Long	11.13	Mile	1:08:35													Zero fucking clue how I pulled this one off. It was a nice day and a flat road, but I was hungover at the start of it. Fucking awesome run though, I'm glad my first steady run a month ago wasn't a fluke and that I can do one on my own. Definitely took some concentration at times to focus on form and breathing instead of always looking at my watch and I think that helped me out a lot.<br><br>After last week, this week was great! Good distance runs, some strides, excellent long run, and legs are feeling 100% better. Really excited to get back into workouts next week, let's see how I do.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-12	10:51 AM	Run	Easy	8.03	Mile	1:00:58													Legs were definitely a little tired from Saturday, and there was a surprisingly amount of elevation gain on this run. It was also hot and humid. Still, heartrate was excellent and the pace was slow! Here's to a good week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-13	8:56 AM	Run	Easy	7.06	Mile	0:51:59													Nice and easy downtown loop, legs feeling a little weak still but better than yesterday!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-07-14	9:15 AM	Run	Easy	1.85	Mile	0:13:31													Cooldown around the neighborhood. Although it felt a little harder than I would have liked, this was definitely my best tempo of the summer yet. The loop was fun, although a little too short for my liking, but I had a good time. Legs also felt surprisingly spry afterwards, which is a good sign of my recovery. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-15	9:01 AM	Run	Easy	7.05	Mile	0:52:06													Easy peazy rail trail run. Legs feeling pretty good.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-16	10:26 AM	Run	Easy	6.08	Mile	0:44:07													Neighborhood run in some slight rain, legs felt good when I wasn't going up any of the crazy ass hills I've been finding recently. Also did 6 x 30 second strides after.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v3	61.00								
2021-07-17	11:25 AM	Run	Long	12.00	Mile	1:24:31													Spectacular long run on Tower Ridge Road! Started this one pretty late (11:30 am) and felt some of the heat, although the shade was able to protect me. Turns out it was only 75 degrees but it felt waaaay hotter than that at the end. Struggled really hard on the last mile and barely broke 6:30, I think lack of hydration and food was really getting to me. Also had some annoying back/side cramps on the latter half of the run. Still a really solid run though, especially with the 700 ft of total elevation gain!<br><br>Overall this was about as good of a week as I could have imagined myself having. Great tempo, great long run, and good easy runs throughout the rest of the week. Let's see if I can keep this up until school starts, where hopefully training gets much easier without working outside.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00								
2021-07-19	8:13 AM	Run	Easy	8.03	Mile	1:00:34													Ez run on Knightridge road, legs are feeling good but I wanted to take it sloooow today.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v4	60.00

2021-07-20	9:15 AM	Run	Easy	1.32	Mile	0:10:10													Cooldown. This loop is fucking hard dude, went counter clockwise to avoid a lot of the long inclines but there was a pretty sizeable hill every loop, strava had every loop (0.85) at 40ish ft of elevation. Plus a section in the woods that required some special footwork. Slower pace aside though, this was a great workout! Really wanted to stop after 20 minutes, but pushed through and made this a really good day. I think this was also a good workout loop in that this will make the Brohn loop feel like a cakewalk when I get back to school.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-07-21	8:34 AM	Run	Easy	7.13	Mile	0:52:03													Nice and easy loops on the IUXC course, legs actually felt pretty solid today.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-07-23	8:01 AM	Run	Easy	6.10	Mile	0:44:43													Rail trail 6 mile loop, wanted to go a little slower today to save myself for a good long run tomorrow.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-07-24	8:50 AM	Run	Long	11.85	Mile	1:19:12													My first solo McGowan loop, and boy oh boy did this motherfucker hurt. Went out pretty quick before I got to the hilly section, but mile 3 was flooded with knee high water so I was slowed down pretty hard. I regrettably stopped a little over halfway on the big hill and walked for a minute or two towards the top. Had some pretty solid miles after though so I can't be too upset, and averaged a pretty good pace all throughout! Overall solid week of training.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-07-26	10:33 AM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	1:00:38													Easy run down down Iverness road, looots of hill on the way back but it wasn't too bad in the shade.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-07-27	8:24 AM	Run	Easy	9.03	Mile	1:03:59													Found a new route down Tapp road, tried to loop it back on Rockport but I got scared by all the big trucks and went back on the rail trail, adding an extra 2 miles. Oh well, at least the legs felt good today!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-07-28	9:00 AM	Run	Easy	1.15	Mile	0:8:25													Cooldown. I went waaay faster than I expected to, which I could feel very early on. I was tempted to not even start the third set, but I figured a few extra minutes of running wouldn't hurt. I'm glad I didn't attempt the 3rd 3' rep, my legs were already hurting and I had to work right after. Really awesome first fartlek, and almost 3 miles of this pace is nothing to be ashamed about. Next time I'll shoot for 4 miles of work.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-07-29	8:17 AM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:52:14													Downtown loop, keeping it easy despite all the damn hills in this town.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-07-31	9:44 AM	Run	Long	12.00	Mile	1:21:16													This run was a little sad. I thought I found a trail where there wasn't one, so I had to run on random roads that I didn't want to run on. Also started out hot, 6:30/6:10/6:10 the first three miles but I could tell I wasn't going to be able to hold it. I don't know why I even tried since I had a hard long run last week, so it's a good thing I slowed down to about 7 minute pace for the rest of the run. Otherwise, it's been a good week, but I am definitely ready for a down week next week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-02	2:35 PM	Run	Easy	6.02	Mile	0:45:11													Zville rail trail run, trying not to look at my watch so much and it worked pretty well! Legs are definitely a little sore.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-08-04	9:15 AM	Run	Easy	3.21	Mile	0:24:01													Felt like SHIT today, thanks working outside all summer! I'm officially giving up on workouts until I go back to school, my legs just can't handle this shit anymore. Also, fuck the byran park loop for having an awkward turn by the tennis courts, and for having shitty small hills like every other god forsaken loop in this town.

2021-08-05	8:59 AM	Run	Easy	5.65	Mile	0:42:46													Easy recovery run out to Rogers, back through Olcott.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-06	9:24 AM	Run	Easy	6.23	Mile	0:45:24													Tried my luck at another westside loop, started at switchyard and make a loop on 2nd-3rd street. Legs felt much better as the run went on.																	
2021-08-08	8:42 AM	Run	Long	11.15	Mile	1:21:43													Fun and relaxed yellowwood loop with da bois. Legs felt pretty solid today, although the hills always suck.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-09	10:21 AM	Run	Easy	8.06	Mile	0:57:20													I was ready for another shitshow of a run, but I felt FANTASTIC today! Went out and back on knightridge road in the pouring rain, and I loved every second of it.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-10	9:18 AM	Run	Easy	7.91	Mile	0:56:37													Don't let the pace fool you, I did not feel good on this rail trail out and back. Although it was fun reaching the end of the limestone greenway for the first time all summer, the humidity was absolutely brutal. The last 2 miles were a real slog.

2021-08-11	10:17 AM	Run	Easy	4.10	Mile	0:30:44													I was weak today, ran late and I paid the cost. The humidity and heat got to me and I'm making myself double.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-08-12	8:10 AM	Run	Easy	5.95	Mile	0:45:43													Felt like absolute dog water today, even with an early run. Heat index was high and the IU course was unforgiving. Wanted to hit 7 today, but did not have the gonads for it.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-13	8:14 AM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:44:02													Another chill run on the rail trail this week, had a bunch of boys come out for a pre meat run.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-08-14	8:58 AM	Run	Easy	1.09	Mile	0:8:07													Cooldown on the track. Was expecting a midsummer race today, but it was cancelled and nobody knew about it! We opted for a 5K on the track instead, which I was not quite as excited for but oh well. Legs felt pretty solid and I'm happy with the time. I was on my own for almost all of the race and there's no way I could have held up with Andy and Isaac under 16 minutes.<br><br>Overall this week was not the mileage heavy hitter I was hoping for, the heat really fucked it up. However, I managed to get a nice fitness benchmark and I should be pretty fresh for some workouts in the coming months. Excited to see what I can do now that I won't work and should have some people to run with in the club!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-16	9:26 AM	Run	Easy	8.04	Mile	0:59:12													Easy run on the PUXC course, man I forgot how nice it was compared to the shitshow that is IU's course.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-08-17	4:00 PM	Run	Easy	2.96	Mile	0:21:40													Cooldown in the rain. Didn't manage to hit 4 miles, but this was a good tempo nonetheless. I think running in the afternoon for the first time, after a solid 5k a couple of days ago, was more tiring than I expected. Still happy with this though!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-18	4:53 PM	Run	Easy	6.52	Mile	0:50:05													Brutal post move-in run, legs are completely destroyed and it was hot as balls so I went for a nice sandy river trail run.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-19	9:56 AM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	0:59:52													A little less destroyed today and did a backwards Walmart loop.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-21	4:28 PM	Run	Easy	7.76	Mile	0:59:49													Some easy bog running, another day of slow running. It feels so good. Took Friday off because my lower back was on fire after all the moving, but it's feeling better now.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-22	6:17 PM	Run	Easy	3.71	Mile	0:28:29													Had a long run planned for today, but got incredibly drunk the previous night and now here I am. This run really sucked for how little distance and easy the pace was. Oh well, on to next week!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-23	4:53 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:51:55													First day with the run club, it was fucking PACKED. Saw a few old friends, made a few new ones, but I think I'm gonna stick to doing distance runs on my own. Did diamond loop for 5, then a few IM loops for an extra 2 miles.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-24	4:30 PM	Run	Easy	2.03	Mile	0:15:30													Warmup - 1 mile to co-rec, 1 mile to the XC course.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-08-24	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.72	Mile	0:12:48													Cooldown straight back home. This workout was comical because of how hot it was, heat index of 100+! It was really nice working out with people again though. Started out with the top group and managed to finish top 5, it's only a tempo but I was curious how I would stack up against club talent. I think I'll be able to stick around these guys for most workouts. Felt better than most people too I think, the heat sucked but finished fairly strong without bonking.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-25	5:23 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:54:18													Did a happy hollow loop for 4 miles, then river trail out and back for a little more. It was 100 again today so I took it slow like I was a sophomore in high school again.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-26	3:28 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:51:22													WONDERFUL WEATHER (it was like 85 and cloudy outside) on a 231 loop. Legs felt much better today than yesterday, although they were definitely a tad sore.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-08-27	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	2.09	Mile	0:16:44													Cooldown straight back home. It was another hot one today, although didn't feel quite as bad as Tuesday. Managed to stick with, and even take the lead slightly for the last two reps, the top group again, although I didn't manage to do the sixth and final rep. I wanted to take it easy after the tempo on Tuesday, especially since I was starting to really feel it on the fifth rep. I'd consider this workout another success!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-28	10:33 AM	Run	Long	10.12	Mile	1:16:20													Steamy mid-morning long run on left river, legs felt rough the last two miles but I got the job done. Overall this was a surprisingly solid week given how fucking crazy the weather has been. I think I ran during a heat advisory everyday of the week, did two workouts and a long run, and managed to come out on top! Really happy with this week, much better than my first week at school last year.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-08-30	4:00 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	1:00:48													Easy run in the bog, legs felt great today and HR was SUPER LOW! I'm astounded how well I recovered from last week, and not the best sleep the past few days (7ish hours Saturday and Sunday night). Ready to crush some workouts this week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-08-31	5:30 PM	Run	Easy	2.88	Mile	0:21:46													Cooldown back starting on the bike path to home. Decent workout, started to fall apart on the 4th mile and knew it was time to call it quits. I was feeling sorry for myself and definitely could have pushed harder on the last mile, but at least I progressed. Top group got away from me and finished the 5th mile out. Little disappointing, but we were in the heat the entire time and I think starting at 6:15 was just a mistake if I wanted to finish the whole thing. Still have the workout on Friday though, job ain't done. <br><br>Also did 4x30 second strides after this on the ag fields by the bike path.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-01	4:31 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:52:16													Easy out and back on the soft and sandy heritage trail. Felt a lot better today than I expected to given my performance yesterday, but I'll take it!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-02	4:29 PM	Run	Easy	6.20	Mile	0:45:37													Easy run to the cumberland park, legs felt gooood today.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-09-03	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.64	Mile	0:12:27													Cooldown back to the house. Fucking stellar workout, this went 1000x better than Tuesday! Went into it thinking I would only do 4, but I kept hitting good times and felt strong so I went for 5 and finished quick! Managed to stay within the top of the top group for all of the reps (except the first, was probably 10 seconds back). Super impressed with how these past 2 weeks of workouts have been, let's keep this shit up.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-05	5:06 PM	Run	Long	11.30	Mile	1:22:07													Nice and easy long run. Legs are definitely a little sore from Friday's tempo miles and all the walking around campus yesterday. Great fucking week of 50 with 2 solid workouts, let's do it again.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-06	3:53 PM	Run	Easy	8.01	Mile	1:00:28													Some easy jogging on the bog. Legs are still feeling a little tired, but heartrate is doing just fine.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-07	4:35 PM	Run	Easy	2.37	Mile	0:18:42													Warmup to corec then XC course				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-09-07	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.75	Mile	0:14:09													0.86 from PUXC to Slayter, 0.89 from Slayter to back home. This was my first speed day in a long minute, so my legs are understandably pretty worn out. Felt pretty good though, definitely was a second or too off the top guys on each 200m rep but I didn't want to totally trash myself. The Slayter hills were just a doozy, I think I hit like 6:30 pace on them so nothing special. Gonna recover the next two days and try to make Friday a good workout.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-08	4:33 PM	Run	Easy	6.53	Mile	0:51:38													Didn't mean to run with the club today, but I'm glad I did because my legs were feeling shitty if I ran anything close to 7:30 pace. This was a very necessary diamond loop.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-09	4:29 PM	Run	Easy	6.42	Mile	0:48:21													I was really pushing the pace here compared to yesterday, legs are definitely sore as shit still from Tuesday. Heartrate was tame though. Kept it easy on an extended campus loop and a neighborhood loop, all flat baby.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-10	4:37 PM	Run	Easy	2.05	Mile	0:15:12													Warmup to the corec then the course.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-09-10	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	2.28	Mile	0:17:03													Cooldown to Sigma Pi for a meeting, then back to the house. I'm not sure if this was an interval or a tempo workout, but man I felt good! I was expected to hit more around 3:30, but I hit 3:23-3:24 for the first 3-4 and figured hey, this is what my body wants. Got a little competitive on the last one and outkicked a few guys for the 3:11. All in all awesome workout!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-12	3:10 PM	Run	Long	12.21	Mile	1:33:02													Sweet and sexy out and back on the ouietenon trail, I absolutely love running slow now. Legs were definitely a little tired from this week's work and mileage still, and it was 90 degrees today, but the shade and the easy pace made it bearable. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-13	5:11 PM	Run	Easy	8.00	Mile	0:59:50													Relatively late and quick run in the bog today, legs are definitely a little weary after the long run yesterday. Taking a sweet, sweet down week after this one though!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-09-14	4:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.72	Mile	0:12:51													Warmup straight to the XC course				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00

2021-09-14	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.89	Mile	0:14:42													Cooldown back home. Today was back to the heat, 90 degrees and sunny :( Legs never felt that great, even during the first 4 tempo reps. Fell back from the group on the 5th one and really thought about calling it quits after 6, but with some encouragement from Mike and with the grace of god, I held on through all 8. The slowest reps were all on the hilly back section of the course, and the fastest ones were generally on the flat section of the course. Placed great within the club, probably was 5th or 6th man, but I don't hold it against anyone who couldn't keep up just given the work load we've had the past few weeks and with the heat today. Now it's time to rest until Saturday!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-15	4:12 PM	Run	Easy	8.03	Mile	1:00:17													Beautiful day on left river, shaded and all. Legs felt surprisingly good after yesterday's tough workout. Got a little tight towards the end but that was probably because of some elevation gain. Two more days of this baby!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-09-16	4:26 PM	Run	Easy	6.85	Mile	0:50:37													Nice easy Walmart loop, legs feeling a little stiff still but feeling okay.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-09-18	11:55 AM	Run	Easy	1.95	Mile	0:16:26													Cooldown after the race. This race was a total shitshow, from the brutal hills and gravel path to the unmarked turn that literally the entire field missed. The activity I have posted is from when I stopped my watch at the 8k, but still jogged it in to the finish line and managed to finish 8th/83 somehow, definitely should have gone way faster. Didn't really have a kick, last half mile was a joke because I was so confused, but we were all in the same boat.<br><br>Overall this will be a fun memory to look back on, definitely worth the 15 bucks.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-09-20	3:59 PM	Run	Easy	8.08	Mile	0:58:55													Cool little loop going up to Kalberer and back, legs felt surprisingly good after the race on Saturday!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v5	54.00								
2021-09-21	3:23 PM	Run	Easy	6.81	Mile	0:49:18													Another day of feeling good! Ran a Ahlers-231 loop in the slightly rainy and windy weather, felt nice and cool out. Legs felt a little tight on the last couple miles, I think I'm just not used to running this speed after a month of going slow because of the 90 degree heat death.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-09-22	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.92	Mile	0:14:41													Cooldown back home. Definitely went pretty fast on the last tempo mile, but wanted to stick with the top pack since it was a short workout. Felt pretty good all things considered, probably would have been faster if it wasn't for the rain and slick pavement on some turns. 200's were pretty solid, legs were tired after the tempo. Good workout for a "down" week!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-09-23	4:42 PM	Run	Easy	8.27	Mile	1:00:49													Munger trail loop, felt pretty good today with 65 degrees and windy!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-09-24	6:40 PM	Run	Easy	5.13	Mile	0:39:03													Easy campus loop after this. I realized I haven't broken 5 for a mile in a couple of years, so I wanted to see if I still had it. Turns out I have quite a bit more lol, I think I could have pushed this down to a 4:45 if it was an actual race. Pretty sweet for having very little speed training at this point in time, gives me some confidence in running a little faster in workouts. Legs were fairly tired after even though heartrate was sub 150, felt reaaaally weak the last mile but I think that's because I hadn't eaten since 10:30. Feeling pretty cool after this!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-09-26	2:34 PM	Run	Long	12.03	Mile	1:28:00													Clutch LR on the twyck greenway, legs were a little tired from the weekend's debauchery but nothing I can't handle.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-09-28	5:45 PM	Run	Easy	1.63	Mile	0:12:29													Really solid steady run. I figured we would hover around 6:00-6:10 pace, but 5:50 actually wasn't that hard to maintain until we turned left onto state street after the sexy downhill. Really turned it on up the hill on McCormick and managed to finish very well on the team. Plus, with all this extra mileage in my pocket, I get low mileage for the rest of the week!

2021-09-30	5:33 PM	Run	Easy	6.88	Mile	0:50:50													Woke up feeling ever so slightly tired today, feeling like I might be catching a cold. Run went well anyways though, legs were a little more fatigued than I would have expected but breathing and heartrate was good!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-10-04	5:27 PM	Run	Easy	6.91	Mile	0:51:59													Woke up with a fever on Friday, feeling a little better today so decided to go for it. Legs were feeling fatigued by mile 4-5, looking back on this I was definitely pushing it too hard by running 7 (or even at all).				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-10-18	2:56 PM	Run	Easy	4.00	Mile	0:29:31													Welp :( Had a terrible cough for about two weeks, had two pink eyes right after my last run thanks to a shitty fly that got in my eye (and then dug out without washing my hands properly), a sore throat, etc. Then I got the flu shot last Tuesday and proceeded to feel like shit all over again. Figured my season was over anyways, so just waited a few extra days to let the body fully heal and start over. Not too bummed, 8k's are painful as shit anyways and I don't mind having the next few weekends to do fun stuff for my last semester. On to track season!

2021-10-25	4:59 PM	Run	Easy	4.00	Mile	0:30:08													Legs and lower back feel MUCH better after a couple of days off. I woulda ran more last week, but it was a long week of partying and it was hard to find the motivation to run during all of that when my body was hurting.

2021-10-26	4:26 PM	Run	Easy	5.00	Mile	0:36:05													Got a little excited today on a lagoon loop and picked up the pace. Legs were feeling exquisite, breathing was a little tough as expected.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-10-27	3:59 PM	Run	Easy	4.10	Mile	0:29:51													Ran up happy hollow road today, and it was actually not terrible! Managed a 7:09 mile somehow as I was going up, pretty good news for my fitness levels I guess. Otherwise a nice 57 degree day.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-10-31	5:53 PM	Run	Long	8.05	Mile	0:55:31													Nice 50ish degrees 231 loop, legs felt good so I went a lil quick today. Finished with a 6:07 mile too! <br><br>Overall this was a really nice week, legs felt waaaaay better than last week. I'm excited to start doing some slight speedwork next week, I haven't had speed in these old legs of mine for quite some time.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-11-02	3:43 PM	Run	Easy	5.00	Mile	0:36:00													Happy hollow loop with 4 quick strides after. I knew they were quick because I was very tired after the last one.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-11-03	5:14 PM	Run	Easy	5.39	Mile	0:38:21													A slightly new highway loop, nice to break up the monotony.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-11-05	3:09 PM	Run	Easy	5.99	Mile	0:43:05													Ran to the track, did 4 laps of in and outs, then a campus loop. Similar to the strides, the last couple reps were painful, but I recovered fairly quick after. Just trying to shock my body to something a little fast.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-11-07	4:32 PM	Run	Long	9.06	Mile	1:06:50													I planned on doing XC loops, but I saw the course coyote so I ditched that idea and did a bog+walmart loop instead. Legs were definitely a little tired today, but felt more solid at the end than at the beginning. Overall solid week of training, pace was faster than I expected and the strides+in and outs went well! Excited for a little more mileage and stuff next week.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-11-09	3:42 PM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:44:24													Wasn't quite as pretty today as yesterday, but good enough for a left river run. I had no idea my house is only a mile away from the connection to one of the overpasses, kinda late now that the trail is gonna be shit all winter. <br><br>Did 6 x 30 second strides after this, legs were jello after 4 but pushed through. I feel speed.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-11-12	3:06 PM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:45:15													6 laps of in and out today, legs actually felt a lot better than last week. Pretty easily managed the extra 4 reps, I don't know how my speed matched up though. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-11-13	3:50 PM	Run	Long	10.16	Mile	1:13:48													Cherry Lane loop with Mike, then an out and back on Salisbury. Legs were a little tired today, but managed to keep pace pretty solid! Overall this was another awesome week, excited to hold 40 and start doing some real workouts. I think I'm ready.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-11-15	4:05 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:50:16													Nutty sleet on a walmart loop, honestly stayed pretty warm with my thicker blue longsleeve and orange rain jacket. When I was going into the wind the last few miles though, there was no protecting my poor face.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-11-16	3:00 PM	Run	Easy	4.00	Mile	0:32:01													200m rests + cooldown. This workout went great! I'm actually surprised I managed to hit an average lower than 33.5 (goal race pace), even if I had slightly over a minute of jogging rest in between each rep. This has got to be my fastest 200 meter workout in a long while. The wind on the backstretch was rough the last couple laps, and those last two reps were definitely the most difficult, but I tried to focus on form like it was a stride and let my legs carry me through. I'll probably have to slow down for the 300 reps next week, but this is an excellent start!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-11-18	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	6.00	Mile	0:45:14													Another sore run today, although windy as FUCK. Ran a highway loop and that was a mistake. The middle two miles were straight into wind as I was climbing the gradual incline from the bottom of river road to the top of state street. Oh well, it builds character.

2021-11-19	3:30 PM	Run	Easy	1.90	Mile	0:14:12													Cooldown back to the house. In the spirit of training for the mile, and since the first tempo of all my seasons always sucks donkey nuts, I decided to make today short and quick. I definitely started feeling it a little into the second mile, but managed to pick it up in the last quarter mile and finish faster than the first mile. All in all great first tempo!

2021-11-20	3:46 PM	Run	Long	10.00	Mile	1:13:58													Didn't really want to run today, but it was 50 degrees and sunny on this fine november day and I couldn't refuse! The legs were a little tired today, but it was worth the beautiful weather. Overall this was a fantastic week of training, mileage felt easy and the workouts went better than expected. I'll do another week of this, then maybe take a slight down week and keep on going from there.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

Wasn't really feeling the workout today, been busy with the doggy day out and my legs just weren't as snappy as I was hoping for. I was also very out of breath towards the end which surprised me. I guess this is my first track workout in real cold weather, just gotta adapt. All things considered though it was a solid workout. Only my second real track work, and I have 3 more months to be in tip top shape. Everything now is just a baseline.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-11-25	7:50 AM	Run	Easy	1.87	Mile	0:14:38													Turkey trot was 45.. and rainy as fuck. Stayed pretty warm though. Had a fun time with the top pack, 7 other guys from the team. Legs were unfortunately pretty tired today, but we went easy until the last half mile and went solidly under 5 minute pace. Finished 5th in our pack, just right behind Andy and Henry as I couldn't outsprint them. Good times with good friends!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-11-27	12:54 PM	Run	Easy	6.29	Mile	0:46:40													Legs were absent today for some reason, so I took it easy on a happy hollow loop.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-11-28	3:45 PM	Run	Long	10.41	Mile	1:15:23													I fucking HATE THE WIND! My dick was SHEARED the entire run, especially miles 2-5 where I was running directly into 18 mph wind. I had to pull over right around mile 5 just to make sure I wasn't bleeding it hurt so bad. The last five miles weren't quite as bad, at least the legs felt better than yesterday.<br><br>Overall this week was not what I expected. The 300's were cut short and a little slower than I wanted, the turkey trot felt way harder than it should have for an 18:30, and most of my easy runs were just a little sloggish. I think it's just been a busy week that didn't allow for much time/prep/focus for most of these runs, especially with two early morning runs back to back. Next week should be a little easier.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-12-02	3:00 PM	Run	Easy	3.40	Mile	0:26:47													Cooldown on a campus loop. I planned on doing 4x200 after the 400's, but my legs were WHIPPED! I'm actually very happy with how this went, managing to average a little faster than 68 was better than I expected, especially with all those fucking kids in the way and the wind on the home stretch. I think this was a more impressive workout than the 8x200's I did a couple of weeks ago considering I had a minute rest after each rep, and they weren't much faster than the pace I was going today. Really happy with this.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-12-06	4:56 PM	Run	Easy	7.00	Mile	0:55:11													Very slow run on a cold and windy day. Legs are very sore from yesterday's long run, which is concerning because I went pretty slow on that run too. Between the insane (25mph) wind and sore legs, I figured it was best if I hit a light jog. Ran some loops in happy hollow which managed to shield me from the wind pretty well. Hopefully tomorrow my legs are up for some 300s!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-12-07	2:35 PM	Run	Easy	2.16	Mile	0:18:18													Lane 6 rest and cooldown mileage. This workout was awesome! Really wasn't feeling it since it's 20 degrees out right now, and my legs have been awkwardly sore the past couple days. Still managed to run 2 more reps than the last 300s workout, and averaged a whole second faster! Definitely need to take it easy the next two days though if I want to run a tempo, the legs are definitely still sore.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-12-08	2:38 PM	Run	Easy	6.69	Mile	0:51:07													Legs felt fucking fantastic (sore, but not tired) on a bog jog today! And it was sunny and high thirties, I was honestly sweating in the thick long sleeve and Culver T. Little less than 7 because I literally ran into Lauren on the stadium alleyway, figured I was close enough to call it quits.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-12-09	2:04 PM	Run	Easy	7.16	Mile	0:52:05													I don't think my first mile was a 6:53... but I guess I felt pretty good today. Legs still a little sore, but not fatigued!

2021-12-10	3:45 PM	Run	Easy	2.73	Mile	0:20:19													Cooldown. I was a little worried about today given how sore I've been lately, but it went pretty well! Felt great that first mile, then not so great that second mile, then I was definitely pushing it that last half mile. I think that last half mile is how I felt on the last half mile last run, and I ran a whole extra half mile! It would appear that progress is being made. For tempos this fast, I'm ok with increasing distance just one half mile at a time. 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-12-12	3:57 PM	Run	Long	11.14	Mile	1:18:51													Felt strong on a 231-cumberland loop! This was the first distance run of the season where I felt just plain good. Legs weren't sore, although certainly got a little tired going up Robinson, and felt like I could drop a sexy mile whenever I wanted to. This is a really good sign given the tough workouts I've had the past two weeks, especially this week!<br><br>I hope to keep this up for two more weeks and get in a couple more solid workouts before taking a down week and letting it all soak in. After that, crunch time begins and hardcore workouts become the focus for awhile. I can feel it all starting to come together.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2021-12-16	2:45 PM	Run	Easy	4.22	Mile	0:34:24													This was a solid fucking workout! Nathaniel joined me and kept me in check as he was only a couple seconds behind me on each rep. The wind was tough on the homestretch and definitely slowed me down on the reps where we had to run the entire homestretch, but I think this makes the workout all the more impressive. Averaging 4:32 pace on a windy day with 1.5 miles of work is awesome! Definitely seeing improvement every workout and I'm really happy.

2021-12-17	4:09 PM	Run	Easy	6.20	Mile	0:46:45													Campus loop inbetween my last two finals. Legs felt fairly decent today considering yesterday's work!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00								
2021-12-18	2:18 PM	Run	Long	11.11	Mile	1:19:15													Sexy, albeit a tad windy and chilly, long run on a salisbury out and back with a slight loop in the county roads. Legs are feeling way better than expected after the workout on Thursday, I think I'm recovering really well! Looking foward to one more week of training and then a down week.

2021-12-22	3:45 PM	Run	Easy	5.39	Mile	0:39:38													A classic Angola lake loop with a slight out and back on Kimble. Took yesterday off because of the booster side effects, was happy to run today after being in the car for 3 hours.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2021-12-23	3:11 PM	Run	Easy	5.03	Mile	0:37:08													Another lake loop with an out and back around lime lake, woulda made another loop out of that but a giant great dane starting getting angry and I was so spooked I turned around!

2021-12-26	3:33 PM	Run	Long	9.00	Mile	1:06:24													An Olcott loop to finish off the down week. Didn't feel quite as good as I did the past couple of days, but I had 440 feet of elevation gain in just 9 miles :( Did manage to run into some Boilermakers while wearing a Purdue shirt, that's always fun in IU territory. Overall good down week!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2021-12-28	3:00 PM	Run	Easy	5.60	Mile	0:40:00													Not a day that I was proud to call myself a runner. Attempted mile time trial went south, and had to double just to hit a measly 5.6 miles for the day. Better times ahead!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2021-12-30	4:05 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:50:57													Not proud of it, but took yesterday off due to lack of motivation. Today went smoothly though on a hillside-3rd street loop!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2021-12-31	10:30 PM	Run	Easy	2.13	Mile	0:15:42													Cooldown after. Fun workout with Isaiah, was feeling pretty tired after the two mile but felt great the third mile. Could have probably gone another mile but didn't want to kill myself on my first workout back in a couple of weeks.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-01-01	6:41 PM	Run	Easy	7.16	Mile	0:53:15													Late night campus loop, hangover finally subsided and came home to some mac and cheese!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-01-02	5:02 PM	Run	Long	11.16	Mile	1:22:02													4 mile loop with Mike, 6.5 mile loop on my own with a small neighborhood loop to round it all out. Kinda fun running in the dark honestly, wasn't too cold. Solid week back at 45, mileage was never too fast this week and the time trial sucked dick but at least I put the hours in. Next week is a new week!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-01-04	4:30 PM	Run	Easy	2.55	Mile	0:21:04													200 rests and cooldown. This was a surprisingly solid workout, felt really good all the way to the end. Probably could have pulled out another 2 to get 1.5 miles but after no speed the past two weeks I didn't want to push it. I'm very happy with 1.25 miles at this pace, onto some harder work next week!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-01-05	4:30 PM	Run	Easy	7.07	Mile	0:52:05													Wind advisory on a 20 degree day, gotta say I love West Lafayette. I sought refuge in the hollow of happy, and it brought me protection from the harsh winds.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-01-06	2:08 PM	Run	Easy	7.07	Mile	0:50:35													Blacked out again on another freezing 13 degree run. Peepee got cold. Walmart loop fun.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-01-08	4:30 PM	Run	Easy	2.83	Mile	0:21:43													Cooldown. Was shooting for a 3 mile tempo, but just wasn't there mentally. Started out in a 2:36 half mile, which looking back on it was definitely too quick, but should not have wrecked me as bad as it did. Wasn't excited for this run and the cold sucked. At least the work I did put in was quality.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-01-09	4:55 PM	Run	Long	11.23	Mile	1:18:42													Awesome long run on a 231-happy hollow loop! Felt fantastic, especially for the cold ass weather and how sucky my run was yesterday. This week was slightly saddening, but at least I worked out twice and got the mileage. There are much worse weeks to have.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-01-11	5:40 PM	Run	Easy	2.87	Mile	0:23:16													Offs and cooldown mileage. Great workout! Probably for the best I slowed down on this tempo, I obviously could not handle 5:25-5:30 pace. 5:40 felt great, the on and offs sucked since we were going straight into the painful wind, but still managed to average a very solid pace.

2022-01-16	4:34 PM	Run	Long	11.01	Mile	1:22:34													4 bog loops! Felt really solid today considering how much partying I've done this week, and after the workouts this week. Solid week over all, workouts were way better than last week. I missed working out with people I think it helps me out a lot.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v6	53.00

2022-01-18	5:30 PM	Run	Easy	1.60	Mile	0:15:52													400m rests and cooldown back home during and after the workout. Rests were slow as fuck, but I'm counting this shit because my mileage was low today. This was another FANTASTIC workout, especially so soon after a tough one on Friday. My legs are definitely feeling it now though, I was already feeling it after the 800's but the 400's really got to me.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-01-23	4:18 PM	Run	Easy	3.84	Mile	0:28:49													Woke up this morning a little fatigued, some body aches, and a scratchy throat. Had a long run planned for today obviously, but seeing as this might be the start of covid, I ran an easy 4 with Mike and called it a down week. Actually felt pretty good during the run but I could tell my legs were heavier than they should be. Also felt a little down the rest of the night, so I'm definitely sick with something.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-01-26	4:05 PM	Run	Easy	5.53	Mile	0:40:59													FIRST RUN WITH POSITIVE COVID CASE! And I felt fantastic ;) although my legs were definitely getting sore towards the end so I didn't push myself to get 6. Heartrate was low and felt stronger than I did on Sunday, so I think I'm getting better. I've also been largely asymptomatic, besides a sore throat when I wake up and some congestion.

2022-01-27	4:32 PM	Run	Easy	7.21	Mile	0:53:05													Looks like I'm back in business baby! Felt even stronger today, legs still felt sore towards the end of this run but that could have been due to all the snow and taking turns slowly to make sure I don't eat shit on the sidewalks. Also hit every god damn light this run but maybe that's for the best while I'm coming back. I'm stoked I beat covid this quickly, I'll take two weeks of slightly less mileage if it means I'm good for the rest of the semester!

2022-01-30	5:11 PM	Run	Long	9.51	Mile	1:07:05													Felt really smooth on a neat exploration of the neighborhood across from 231.

2022-02-01	3:30 PM	Run	Easy	4.10	Mile	0:31:03													Spectacular weather outside, but not a good day. I'm calling this my "mid track crisis" and starting over. Just upset in general with how training has been these past few months. Sucks to have consistency good workouts for a few weeks, then winter break hits, then covid, then the incoming snow that will probably stick around for a month and make every track inaccessible. I'm just fucking tired of not accomplishing anything even by running every day, so I'm gonna start doing what I want - sign up for a half marathon, and just train for it. No more of this "be in shape for season" shit that hasn't panned out for the past couple of years, just time to actually do something.

It was a nice 40 degrees and managed to get some of the sunset. The last mile going back home was an absolute slog, going through dark alleyways with cars everywhere coming for the bbal game.

2022-02-17	5:10 PM	Run	Easy	1.64	Mile	0:12:08													Cooldown back home. The weather was fucking terrible today, but I persevered! The first half of the loop was windy to the point of not being able to see, but I was able to catch back up to pace on the second half. Last mile was definitely a struggle, but I'm very happy I stuck with it and even finished relatively quick. The inch or two of snow on the ground didn't help much either, corners were hard to turn and traction was overall not the best, but way better than sleet. For being the longest tempo I've run in months, this was excellent!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-02-18	4:34 PM	Run	Easy	5.15	Mile	0:37:58													Easy going run in the neighborhood, wanted to get around all the ice and slush from yesterday's snow. Legs were definitely a little sore.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

I felt incredible given the 50 degree day that came out of nowhere, the always-annoying wind, and not having a lot of endurance. I imagine I'll be pretty sore the next couple of days but I think if I'm able to keep up long runs around this pace I'll adapt quickly. This week overall was exactly how I imagine a week of half marathon training - simple easy runs, a workout, and a steady long run at whatever pace feels good that day. I had a lot of fun this week and I think that means a lot, I didn't feel happy like this about training when training for the mile so I think this is the right move.

2022-02-21	4:15 PM	Run	Easy	7.01	Mile	0:51:53													Legs were definitely sore as hell today, although surprisingly not tired, after yesterday's long run. Went for a classic walmart loop on a 60 DEGREE DAY! Weather was absolutely gorgeous.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-02-22	4:41 PM	Run	Easy	6.91	Mile	0:52:51													I was definitely still a little sore today, but fuck me the wind was INSANE. This might be the worst wind I've ever run in. My legs were getting kicked out from under me and I slowed down from 7:30 to 8:30 pace just on the slight stretch going up 231 by Pvil. Legs probably didn't get as much rest as I was hoping for today, but I tried my best.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-02-23	4:15 PM	Run	Easy	1.25	Mile	0:9:25													Warmup				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-02-23	5:00 PM	Run	Easy	1.75	Mile	0:13:17													Stellar tempo, longest one in quite some time! I could feel my legs were still decently sore from Sunday, especially on the last couple of miles, but thankfully they weren't that tired. Given that last mile I probably had a few more seconds in me on each mile but I didn't want to push too hard after a pretty tough sequence of tempo Thursday, long run Sunday, and tempo today. Weather was a little lousy with 25 degrees and clouds, but beats the hell out of last Thursday! All in all good workout.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-02-25	5:30 PM	Run	Easy	6.01	Mile	0:43:48													Took yesterday off to make sure I wasn't going to have a heart attack, but it worked out because it was another shitty blizzard day. Today was marginally better, still cold and a little icy but I felt great on a campus loop.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-03-20	7:02 PM	Run	Easy	3.03	Mile	0:22:29													First run in quite some time, wasn't that bad! Chest was in the most pain out of anything, and legs are a little sore. I think I'm a little sick too after seeing Lauren and her cold this weekend. Still, good showing after a week in nashville.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-03-23	4:38 PM	Run	Easy	3.14	Mile	0:23:18													Legs, hips, and back are all sore from the past couple days. Average heartrate looked good though, even while talking to mike on a campus loop.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-03-25	4:20 PM	Run	Easy	3.19	Mile	0:23:22													Tried to run off back soreness, but that was a mistake. Gonna take a few days off to recover.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-03-30	3:50 PM	Run	Easy	4.27	Mile	0:31:01													Cherry lane MEDIUM LONG RUN! Front knee tendon was feeling kinda funny today, but it calmed down towards the end. Otherwise felt great!				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-03-31	3:28 PM	Run	Easy	3.15	Mile	0:23:20													Knee still feeling a little tweaked.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-04-04	4:16 PM	Run	Easy	4.01	Mile	0:29:56													Really wanted a long run this past weekend, but took it easy to give the knee some rest. Seemed to work, felt great on a happy hollow loop.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00

2022-04-08	4:50 PM	Run	Easy	4.13	Mile	0:29:57													Cherry Lane loop with mr. michael. Intestines were still cramping like a mofo so I don't think I'll be running this weekend so I can give my alcohol ridden body a break. Legs felt good though.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-04-11	3:49 PM	Run	Easy	4.01	Mile	0:29:05													Happy Hollow loop on a finally warm day (63 lol). Felt kinda out of shape going up Quincy St hill, but mostly from lack of cardio as opposed to legs. I would like to get to a long run this weekend to work on that cardio game.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-04-12	4:56 PM	Run	Easy	4.01	Mile	0:27:25													Decided to go for a faster run today and I definitely felt out of shape. Managed to finish strong with a 6:25 though, and that was including going up chauncey! 				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-04-13	3:45 PM	Run	Easy	5.01	Mile	0:35:57													Another lagoon loop, this time in the drizzling rain! Weather actually felt really nice, as did my legs which recovered well after yesterday's speedy run.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-04-14	4:45 PM	Run	Easy	4.00	Mile	0:29:46													Another happy hollow loop this week to escape the insane winds. Legs were a little more tired today than usual so I took it easy.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v7	50.00								
2022-04-15	4:01 PM	Run	Easy	4.00	Mile	0:28:59													Another fucking windy day. I didn't feel like running happy hollow a third time this week, so I opted for a campus loop. Wasn't too bad, some slight soreness in my left Achilles and knee, the former probably being from new shoes.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v8	50.00								
2022-04-18	4:21 PM	Run	Easy	4.01	Mile	0:29:31													Chilly 40 degree happy hollow loop. I don't think I've ever worn tights in April before, fuck me.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v8	50.00

2022-04-28	4:16 PM	Run	Easy	4.01	Mile	0:29:21													Definitely felt a little tired today on a Lafayette loop, could have been the four whiteclaw surges I drank last night and some not-so-good sleep mixed with the last two runs I've done.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v8	50.00								
2022-04-29	4:42 PM	Run	Easy	4.14	Mile	0:30:29													A nice WHT run! I haven't been here in ages because I thought it would be muddy af, but it was actually pretty nice. Legs a little tired.				Reebok	Forever Floatride Energy 2	9.00	US/Canada	v8	50.00
